**"The Accuracy-Bias Trade-Offs in AI Text Detection Tools and Their Impact on Fairness in Scholarly Publication."**

This project evaluates several widely-used AI-generated text detection tools and examines how their trade-offs between accuracy and bias may lead to unfair outcomes, especially in the context of scholarly publication.

## 🔍 Research Questions

1. How accurate are AI text detection tools in identifying human-written, AI-generated, and AI-assisted texts in scholarly articles? 
2. Is there any accuracy-bias trade-off in AI text detection tools?
3. Do certain groups of researchers face disadvantages when their work is evaluated by AI text detection tools?
