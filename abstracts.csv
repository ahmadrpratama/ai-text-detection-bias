Specifically, it focuses on Hungarians working or volunteering in institutions of refugee accommodation in Germany. It asks how personal migration experience and migrant statuses and identities of Hungarian workers are mobilised when recreating discourses of refugee-deservingness. Performance expectations on refugees related to education and employment evoked references to similarities of migration experience, strengthening an empathetic perspective towards refugee clients and students. Deservingness frameworks related to culture were more ambiguous. A ‘mission civilisatrice’, that is educating Muslim Others to European, non-Muslim ways of behaving and thinking, often tied to gender relations, was paralleled by a continuous attempt to challenge and dismantle such discourses of difference and disciplining. These ambivalences of empathetic identification and disciplinary racialisation draw the contours of a characteristic place of (Hungarian) migrant workers in the governance of refugee accommodation in Germany.","This article investigates how Hungarian migrants employed at refugee accommodation facilities in Germany construct discourses of deservingness—both for themselves and for the asylum seekers they serve. Drawing on in-depth interviews and ethnographic observations, the study explores how Hungarian staff navigate their own precarious positions as “in-between” migrants, simultaneously facing challenges in the German labor market and exercising authority over refugees from diverse backgrounds. Findings reveal that these workers often articulate a sense of “second-class” status, rooted in their experiences of discrimination, while also claiming moral legitimacy through their comparative advantage in language skills, cultural mediation, and personal empathy. Yet they sometimes reproduce exclusionary narratives about asylum seekers, invoking cultural hierarchies and neoliberal ideals of self-sufficiency. The article argues that these discourses of deservingness illuminate the tensions between economic rationales, humanitarian impulses, and nationalistic sentiments in an evolving European migration landscape. Ultimately, the study highlights how “in-between” migrants engage in complex moral boundary work, reshaping perceptions of who merits rights, resources, and recognition within refugee accommodation institutions.","This article examines the discursive construction of deservingness among Hungarian migrants working in German refugee accommodation centers. Situated within the context of the European ""refugee crisis"" and rising anti-immigrant sentiment, the study analyzes how Hungarian workers navigate their own positionality as migrants while simultaneously engaging in the management and care of refugees. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews, we identify a dominant discourse of ""in-betweenness,"" where Hungarians position themselves between ""undeserving"" refugees and ""deserving"" Germans. This positioning is achieved through narratives that emphasize their own hard work, integration efforts, and perceived cultural proximity to German society, while simultaneously distancing themselves from refugees based on perceived cultural differences and lack of effort.  The study contributes to the literature on migration and deservingness by highlighting the complex and often contradictory ways in which migrants negotiate their own identities and moral worth within hierarchical social structures, revealing the intricate relationship between migration, labor, and the politics of belonging in contemporary Europe.","This article investigates how deservingness discourses shape the membership status of non-citizen groups in Germany, focusing on Hungarians employed or volunteering in refugee accommodation facilities. Specifically, it examines how personal migration experiences and migrant identities among Hungarian workers inform and reproduce notions of refugee deservingness. While education- and employment-centered performance expectations on refugees often highlight overlapping migration experiences and foster empathy, cultural dimensions of deservingness produce more ambiguous outcomes. On one hand, the idea of a “mission civilisatrice”—teaching Muslim Others European, non-Muslim norms—emerges, particularly concerning gender relations. On the other hand, there is a consistent effort to undermine and deconstruct such discourses of difference and discipline. These tensions between empathetic identification and disciplinary racialization underscore the distinctive role that Hungarian migrant workers occupy within the governance of refugee accommodation in Germany.","This article examines how ""discourses of deservingness"" – the ways in which people judge who is worthy of support and belonging – shape the integration of non-citizen groups in Germany. It specifically focuses on Hungarians working or volunteering in institutions that provide housing and support for refugees. The study explores how these Hungarian workers use their own migration experiences, statuses, and identities to construct narratives about refugee deservingness. When performance expectations for refugees, such as education and employment, were discussed, participants often drew parallels with their own migration journeys, fostering empathy for refugee clients and students. For example, some Hungarian workers highlighted the shared experience of navigating a new language and bureaucratic system. However, deservingness frameworks related to culture were more ambiguous. A ""mission civilisatrice"" – a belief in the need to educate Muslim Others in European, non-Muslim ways of thinking and behaving, particularly regarding gender relations – was often expressed. This was simultaneously accompanied by efforts to challenge and dismantle such discourses of difference and discipline. These conflicting perspectives, characterized by both empathetic identification and a form of racialized social control, reveal the complex and often contradictory position of (Hungarian) migrant workers in the governance of refugee accommodation in Germany. Notably, while Hungary has been portrayed as anti-refugee in media narratives, this study reveals a more nuanced reality on the ground, with Hungarian migrants playing a significant, albeit complex, role in supporting refugees in Germany."

In this systematic review, we compare health, work, and social outcomes as well as employee outcomes for workers in the two environments. From a total of 10,242 papers reviewed, we identified 31 papers which met strict inclusion/exclusion criteria of allowing a direct comparison between the office types. The results showed that working in open-plan workplace designs is associated with more negative outcomes on many measures relating to health, satisfaction, productivity, and social relationship. Notable health outcomes included decreased overall health and increased stress. Environmental characteristics of particular concern included noise and distractions, poor privacy, lighting and glare, and poorer temperature control. Most studies indicated negative effects on social relationships and interactions. Overall, the findings showed that while open-plan workplace designs may offer financial benefits for management, these appear to be offset by the intangible costs associated with the negative effects on workers. The study encourages further focused investigations into design factors as well as employee characteristics that might contribute to better outcomes in open-plan designs.","This systematic review examines how open-plan and cellular office layouts influence employees’ psychological well-being and work-related outcomes. Drawing on research from organizational psychology, environmental design, and occupational health, we identified and analyzed studies published between 2000 and 2020. Findings suggest that while open-plan offices can foster enhanced communication and potential cost savings, they also correlate with increased noise distractions, reduced privacy, and lower perceived job satisfaction. Conversely, cellular office designs typically provide greater autonomy and privacy, yet can limit spontaneous collaboration and social interaction. The evidence reveals mixed results regarding productivity and stress: some employees thrive in open-plan settings if noise and privacy issues are well-managed, while others perform better in more enclosed spaces. Contextual factors such as job complexity, individual differences in personality, and the organization’s culture significantly moderate these outcomes. Based on the reviewed studies, the paper highlights the need for flexible and hybrid design solutions that balance open and enclosed spaces. We conclude by urging further research to explore how technological advances, evolving team structures, and increasing emphasis on employee well-being might shape future office design strategies.","This systematic review examines the impact of open-plan and cellular office designs on employee psychological well-being and work-related outcomes.  Despite the increasing prevalence of open-plan offices, their purported benefits remain debated.  We synthesized findings from empirical studies comparing these two office layouts, focusing on outcomes such as job satisfaction, stress, privacy, concentration, communication, and teamwork.  The review identified a complex and often contradictory body of evidence.  While some studies suggest that open-plan offices may enhance communication and collaboration, the majority of research indicates negative impacts on employee well-being, including increased stress, reduced privacy, and difficulty concentrating.  Cellular offices were generally associated with more positive outcomes, particularly in terms of privacy and concentration.  This review highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between office design and employee outcomes, considering factors such as task complexity, individual preferences, and organizational culture.  The findings suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach to office design may be detrimental and that organizations should carefully consider the potential trade-offs involved.","A significant portion of knowledge-based work is performed in open-plan offices rather than traditional cellular offices. This systematic review compares the health, work, and social outcomes associated with each design, drawing on 10,242 studies from which 31 met the criterion of directly comparing the two environments. Findings show that open-plan offices correlate with more negative outcomes in terms of health, job satisfaction, productivity, and social relations. Key concerns include reduced overall health, elevated stress levels, and environmental stressors such as noise, distractions, limited privacy, suboptimal lighting, and compromised temperature control. Additionally, many studies indicate detrimental effects on social relationships and interactions in open-plan spaces. While open-plan designs may offer cost benefits for management, the intangible toll on workers appears to outweigh these advantages. The review underscores the need for further targeted research into design features and employee characteristics that might mitigate these adverse effects.","A significant portion of information-based work now takes place in open-plan offices, a departure from traditional cellular office layouts. This systematic review compares the impact of these two office environments on employee health, work performance, social interactions, and overall well-being. From an initial pool of 10,242 papers, 31 studies met the rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria, allowing for a direct comparison between open-plan and cellular offices. The results consistently indicated that working in open-plan environments is associated with more negative outcomes across various measures, including reduced overall health, increased stress, lower job satisfaction, decreased productivity, and strained social relationships. Specific environmental factors contributing to these negative outcomes included increased noise and distractions, lack of privacy, issues with lighting and glare, and difficulty controlling temperature. While open-plan offices may offer financial advantages for organizations, these appear to be offset by intangible costs associated with negative employee experiences. This review underscores the need for further research into design elements and individual employee characteristics that might contribute to more positive outcomes in open-plan settings. For example, studies could investigate the impact of noise-canceling technologies or flexible work arrangements on employee well-being in open-plan environments."

Completely banning laptops from college classes may seem appealing given the potential drawbacks, but these policies may have unintended consequences. One seemingly successful intervention that can address these conflicting goals is the use of laptop zones and laptop-free zones which allows students who want to use their laptops to continue to do so, without hindering the performance of those who do not. We examine the efficacy of this intervention through the lens of the theory of self-regulated learning. We implemented laptop(-free) zones in two large college courses with a total of 168 students, 60 of whom reported sitting in a laptop-zone. Students sitting in the laptop-free zone performed better on objective measures of learning on the day of learning new material, but this difference was not significant five days later on a measure of retention. Further, there were no differences between these groups on self-rated performance at the point of retention. By examining open-ended responses regarding their motivation to sit in the laptop-free zone or the laptop-zone, we found students who sat in the laptop-free zone typically reported wanting to avoid distractions and enhance their memory of the material/class performance compared to those who sat in the laptop zone. Also, more individuals who sat in the laptop zone reported doing so to ensure completeness of their notes, to look up extra course-related material, and to complete non-course related tasks while listening to the lecture. Lastly, we pose a set of future directions aimed at learning more about the use of laptops in and outside of class, and how we can help students be successful using laptops for learning.","This study investigates the role of laptop-free zones in college classrooms, seeking to understand their impact on student engagement, academic performance, and the overall classroom dynamic. Adopting a mixed-methods design, we integrated quantitative data—such as attendance records, grade distributions, and engagement metrics—with qualitative evidence from focus groups, reflective journals, and classroom observations. Findings suggest that designating certain areas of the classroom as laptop-free can reduce digital distractions, promote more attentive note-taking, and foster richer class discussions. Students occupying these zones often displayed greater sustained focus, while instructors reported an increased sense of connection with their learners. However, some students expressed concerns about reduced flexibility and the need for digital tools to support their individual learning styles. The results underscore that while laptop-free zones may enhance the learning climate for some students, they are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Ultimately, this research highlights the importance of carefully balancing technology use with pedagogical goals, respecting learner preferences, and providing equitable support to ensure that all students benefit from the classroom environment.","Laptop-free zones in college classrooms are becoming increasingly common, yet their impact on student learning and engagement remains debated. This study employs a mixed-methods approach to investigate the multifaceted nature of laptop-free zones. Quantitative data were collected through surveys measuring student perceptions of learning, engagement, and distraction levels in classrooms with and without designated laptop-free zones. Qualitative data, gathered through focus groups and individual interviews, provided deeper insights into students' and instructors' experiences and rationales regarding these zones.  Findings indicate that while students in laptop-free zones report lower levels of distraction, there is no significant difference in perceived learning outcomes compared to non-zoned classrooms. Qualitative data revealed diverse perspectives on the benefits and drawbacks of laptop-free zones, highlighting the importance of pedagogical considerations, student autonomy, and the specific learning context. This study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of laptop policies in higher education, suggesting that a one-size-fits-all approach may not be optimal and advocating for instructor-student collaboration in creating effective learning environments.","Laptop use in college classrooms has been a subject of debate for nearly two decades, with some instructors tempted to ban laptops entirely to reduce distractions. However, such bans may have unintended negative consequences. A balanced intervention is to designate laptop and laptop-free zones, allowing students who wish to use laptops to do so while minimizing disruptions for others. Guided by self-regulated learning theory, we implemented laptop(-free) zones in two large college courses (N = 168). Of these, 60 students reported consistently sitting in a laptop zone. Results indicated that, on the day new material was introduced, students in the laptop-free zone outperformed those in the laptop zone on an objective measure of learning. Five days later, however, both groups performed similarly on a measure of retention, and no differences emerged in self-rated performance. Open-ended responses showed that students who chose laptop-free zones were primarily motivated by the desire to avoid distractions and strengthen memory and class performance. Those who opted for laptop zones often cited the need for complete notes, the ability to look up course-related material, and the convenience of multitasking. Implications and future directions include understanding the nuanced effects of laptop use both inside and outside class, alongside strategies to help students use laptops productively for learning.","The use of laptops in college classrooms has been a contentious issue for nearly two decades.

Existing EMG classification methods, which do not consider EMG features that have distribution with skewness and kurtosis, have limitations such as the requirement to tune hyperparameters. In this paper, we propose a neural network based on the Johnson SU translation system that is capable of representing distributions with skewness and kurtosis. The Johnson system is a normalizing translation that transforms non-normal distribution data into normal distribution data, thereby enabling the representation of a wide range of distributions. In this study, a discriminative model based on the multivariate Johnson SU translation system is transformed into a linear combination of coefficients and input vectors using log-linearization; then, it is incorporated into a neural network structure. This allows the calculation of the posterior probability of each class given the input vectors and the determination of model parameters as weight coefficients of the network. The uniqueness of convergence of the network learning is theoretically guaranteed. In the experiments, the suitability of the proposed network for distributions including skewness and kurtosis was evaluated using artificially generated data. Its applicability to real biological data was also evaluated via EMG classification experiments. The results showed that the proposed network achieved high classification performance (e.g., 99.973% accuracy using Khushaba’s dataset) without the need for hyperparameter optimization.","This paper proposes a novel neural network architecture grounded in the Johnson SU translation system, aimed at enhancing classification performance for electromyogram (EMG) signals. By leveraging the versatile four-parameter Johnson SU distribution, the model captures both skewness and kurtosis in EMG data, which are often underrepresented in traditional approaches. The framework encompasses data preprocessing to eliminate artifacts, feature extraction leveraging Johnson SU transformations, and a specialized neural network that adapts its weights to the statistical properties of the incoming signals. Experimental results on benchmark EMG datasets demonstrate higher classification accuracy and robustness compared to conventional methods, especially under noisy conditions. Additionally, the proposed approach requires fewer training epochs, indicating its computational efficiency. This work underscores the potential of applying advanced statistical distributions within deep learning pipelines for bio-signal analysis, opening avenues for improved real-time prosthetic control, rehabilitation monitoring, and other medical applications reliant on accurate EMG interpretation.","This paper introduces a novel neural network architecture based on the Johnson SU translation system for improved classification performance, particularly in the context of non-Gaussian data. The Johnson SU system provides a flexible framework for modeling diverse data distributions. Our proposed network leverages this flexibility by incorporating Johnson SU transformations within its layers, allowing it to effectively capture complex data characteristics.  We evaluate the network's performance on the task of electromyogram (EMG) signal classification, a domain known for its non-Gaussian nature.  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Johnson SU-based network outperforms traditional neural network architectures, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in classifying different muscle activation patterns.  This work contributes a new approach to neural network design, demonstrating the benefits of incorporating flexible statistical distributions for improved classification accuracy, particularly in applications involving non-Gaussian data like biosignals.

The need for culturally relevant programming to support and empower women to optimize health is well established. Participatory physical activity [PA]-focused programming responsive to the sociocultural realities of Indigenous women may hold promise. However, obesity and chronic disease literature for Indigenous women focusing on PA change predominantly discusses individual behaviors, leaving a knowledge gap around the social and environmental supports needed to realize improved outcomes. We searched PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Bibliography of Native North Americans, and the University of New Mexico’s Native Health Databases for English language peer-reviewed articles on PA-based programs addressing prevention or management of obesity with Indigenous women as a primary focus. Fifteen articles, representing 13 unique programs, were included in the review. Outcome measures included program attendance and factors influencing program acceptance, PA, biochemical markers and blood pressure, weight and waist circumference measurements, the development of social supports, and nutritional knowledge acquisition. Although some studies found improvements in PA level and other outcomes, the marked variability in study design makes it difficult to draw conclusions about best practices for PA-based wellness and weight management programs for Indigenous women. However, programming that acknowledges and provides accommodation for the complex factors that influence behavior, incorporates cultural and community elements, and integrates opportunities for supportive network development may improve outcomes.","This systematic literature review explores the effectiveness of physical activity (PA) interventions aimed at improving health outcomes for Indigenous women. Focusing on published studies from 2005 to 2021, we examined program characteristics, reported impacts on PA levels, obesity metrics (e.g., BMI, waist circumference), and broader social factors such as cultural identity and community cohesion. The findings reveal that culturally tailored interventions—those integrating traditional dances, community gatherings, and culturally relevant education—show greater participant engagement and more sustained increases in PA behavior. Several programs demonstrated modest but significant improvements in weight management and cardiovascular risk factors. Moreover, qualitative outcomes indicate that cultural alignment can bolster participants’ sense of belonging and community support, contributing to longer-term adherence. However, many studies suffer from small sample sizes, lack of control groups, or inadequate follow-up periods, limiting the generalizability of results. Recommendations include strengthening community partnerships, incorporating multifaceted cultural elements, and conducting longitudinal research to better assess the long-term impact of such programs on Indigenous women’s holistic well-being.","This systematic review examines the effectiveness of physical activity-based health programs designed for Indigenous women, focusing on their impact on physical activity levels, obesity-related outcomes, and community building. Indigenous women experience disproportionately higher rates of chronic diseases, including obesity, compared to non-Indigenous populations.  We analyzed empirical studies evaluating physical activity interventions tailored for Indigenous women, assessing changes in physical activity levels, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and other relevant health indicators.  Furthermore, we explored the role of these programs in fostering social connections and strengthening community bonds.  The review found that culturally relevant physical activity programs can lead to positive changes in physical activity levels and improvements in some obesity-related outcomes among Indigenous women.  Importantly, these programs often served as valuable platforms for social interaction, cultural revitalization, and community empowerment. This review highlights the importance of culturally sensitive approaches to health promotion among Indigenous populations and underscores the potential of physical activity interventions to address health disparities and enhance community well-being.","Indigenous women disproportionately experience chronic illnesses and obesity, highlighting the urgency of culturally relevant interventions. Physical activity (PA)-based programming, when tailored to the social and cultural realities of Indigenous women, can provide an avenue for improving health outcomes and promoting empowerment. This systematic review examined English-language, peer-reviewed articles describing PA-focused initiatives aimed at preventing or managing obesity among Indigenous women. From five academic databases, 15 articles covering 13 programs were identified. Key outcome measures included program attendance, factors influencing engagement, PA participation, biochemical markers, weight and waist circumference, social support, and nutritional knowledge. Some studies reported increased PA and other health improvements; however, diverse study designs limit definitive conclusions. Programs incorporating cultural elements, acknowledging multifaceted behavioral influences, and fostering community support appear to enhance engagement and outcomes.","Indigenous women experience a disproportionately high burden of chronic diseases and health challenges, often linked to obesity. Culturally relevant programs that support and empower Indigenous women to improve their health are critically needed. Participatory physical activity (PA) programs that are responsive to the sociocultural realities of Indigenous women hold promise for addressing these health disparities. However, the existing literature on obesity and chronic disease prevention for Indigenous women primarily focuses on individual behavioral changes, leaving a gap in understanding the social and environmental supports necessary for achieving positive outcomes. This systematic review examined 15 articles representing 13 unique PA-based programs designed for Indigenous women, identified through searches of PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Bibliography of Native North Americans, and the University of New Mexico's Native Health Databases. The review focused on English-language, peer-reviewed articles addressing PA programs aimed at obesity prevention or management, with Indigenous women as the primary focus. Outcome measures included program attendance, factors influencing program acceptance, PA levels, biochemical markers, blood pressure, weight and waist circumference, development of social supports, and nutritional knowledge. While some studies reported improvements in PA levels and other outcomes, the significant variability in study designs makes it difficult to establish definitive best practices for PA-based wellness and weight management programs for Indigenous women. Nonetheless, the findings suggest that programs that acknowledge and accommodate the complex factors influencing behavior, incorporate cultural and community elements, and foster the development of supportive social networks may lead to more positive outcomes."

Current emotion recognition in conversations models face issues like: (a) loss of contextual information in between two dialogues of a conversation, (b) failure to give appropriate importance to significant tokens in each utterance, (c) inability to pass on the emotional information from previous utterances. The proposed model of Advanced Contextual Feature Extraction (AdCOFE) addresses these issues by performing unique feature extraction using knowledge graphs, sentiment lexicons and phrases of natural language at all levels (word and position embedding) of the utterances. Experiments on emotion recognition in conversations datasets show that AdCOFE is beneficial in capturing emotions in conversations.","This article presents AdCOFE, a novel approach for extracting contextual features to improve emotion classification in conversational settings. Unlike traditional sentiment analysis methods that rely predominantly on isolated text segments or individual utterances, AdCOFE accounts for the interplay of multiple speakers, shifting emotional states, and evolving dialogue structures. By integrating recurrent neural networks, attention mechanisms, and semantic role labeling, the proposed model captures both short- and long-range dependencies in conversational data. Empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that AdCOFE yields higher accuracy and robustness compared to baseline and state-of-the-art methods, especially for nuanced or overlapping emotional expressions. Additionally, an ablation study confirms the significance of contextual cues—such as speaker identity, turn-taking patterns, and previous utterances—in refining emotion detection. These findings highlight the importance of deeper context modeling for effective emotion classification, opening avenues for enhanced human–machine interaction in domains like customer service, mental health counseling, and social media analytics.","Emotion classification in conversations is crucial for understanding human-computer interaction. This paper introduces AdCOFE (Advanced Contextual Feature Extraction), a novel framework for enhanced emotion recognition in conversational text. AdCOFE leverages contextual information from previous utterances to improve the accuracy of emotion classification.  It employs a hierarchical architecture that first extracts utterance-level features using a bidirectional LSTM network. These features are then fed into a context-aware attention mechanism that weighs the importance of previous utterances based on their relevance to the current utterance. Finally, a classifier predicts the emotion label for the current utterance, considering both its individual features and the contextual information.  Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdCOFE outperforms state-of-the-art methods for emotion classification in conversations.  The proposed framework offers a significant advancement in understanding and interpreting emotions in conversational settings, with potential applications in various domains such as sentiment analysis, chatbot development, and mental health monitoring.","Emotion recognition in conversations is increasingly important for virtual chatbots, social media threads, and online support systems. However, existing approaches often fail to capture (a) contextual information between utterances, (b) the significance of critical tokens, and (c) the propagation of emotional cues from one utterance to the next. To address these gaps, we propose the Advanced Contextual Feature Extraction (AdCOFE) model. AdCOFE integrates knowledge graphs, sentiment lexicons and natural language phrases at multiple levels (word and position embeddings) to more effectively extract features from conversational data. Experimental results on emotion recognition in conversation datasets demonstrate the model’s advantage in identifying relevant emotional states throughout the discourse.","Emotion recognition in conversations is crucial for virtual chatbots that rely on opinion-based feedback, such as those used in social media, online support, and many other applications.

However, the tourism industry itself comprises many sectors, and accessibility measurements may not comprehensively incorporate the simultaneous accessibility of corresponding destinations. Moreover, perspectives are still lacking in the analysis of tourism origin countries. Therefore, this study provides a new approach based on network data envelopment analysis and social network analysis to identify potential opportunities among origin countries for accessibility to a given tourism destination. This study focuses on Taiwan as a tourism destination and measures the efficiency of 32 of its acknowledged tourism origin countries. The main finding is that the involvement of tourism intermediaries (such as tour operators and travel agents) is a key factor influencing most tourism origin countries’ performance. However, tourists make the largest contribution to shared output (i.e., tourism expenditures) for most tourism origin countries. Given the expanding knowledge of tourism management, understanding the accessibility of a destination can help destination managers and governments identify tourism opportunities and execute appropriate strategies.","This study investigates destination accessibility among major tourism origin countries, examining how efficiency measures—such as cost, travel time, and transportation options—impact international travel flows. Leveraging secondary data from global travel databases and tourism statistics, we apply data envelopment analysis (DEA) to rank the relative efficiency of origin–destination pairs. Results indicate that geographical proximity and robust transportation infrastructures often correlate with higher accessibility efficiency scores, thereby encouraging greater visitor volumes. However, pricing strategies, visa regulations, and diplomatic relations can complicate these effects. Sensitivity analyses reveal that political stability and currency exchange rates play pivotal roles in influencing travel decisions. Our findings also highlight that destinations leveraging direct flight routes and streamlined entry processes can position themselves more competitively. The paper concludes with policy implications, suggesting that governments and industry stakeholders should invest in infrastructure development, intergovernmental collaborations, and adaptable pricing models to enhance destination accessibility and capture higher market shares in international tourism.","This study analyzes the efficiency of destination accessibility from various tourism origin countries, employing Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to assess the relative performance of different countries in facilitating tourist arrivals.

Using data on international tourist arrivals, transportation infrastructure indicators, and visa restrictiveness indices, we evaluated the efficiency of destination accessibility for a sample of countries.  The DEA model identified countries that effectively utilize their resources to attract tourists, as well as those that could improve their efficiency.  The findings reveal significant variations in accessibility efficiency across different origin countries, highlighting the importance of targeted policies and investments to enhance destination competitiveness.  This study contributes to the tourism literature by providing a novel approach to assessing destination accessibility from an efficiency perspective, offering valuable insights for policymakers and tourism stakeholders seeking to optimize tourism flows.","Accessibility is a critical factor shaping tourism flows and industry performance. Nevertheless, existing measures often overlook the integrated accessibility of various tourism sectors and rarely focus on tourism-origin countries’ perspectives.

Results suggest that tourism intermediaries, such as tour operators and travel agents, significantly affect performance. Meanwhile, tourists themselves are the largest contributors to shared output in the form of tourism expenditures. Understanding these efficiency patterns enables destination managers and policymakers to identify new tourism opportunities and plan more effective strategies to enhance overall accessibility.","The level of accessibility significantly impacts regional tourism flow and the overall performance of the global tourism industry. However, the tourism industry is multifaceted, and traditional accessibility measures often fail to fully capture the simultaneous accessibility of various destinations. Moreover, analyses often lack a focus on the perspective of tourism origin countries.

The key finding is that the involvement of tourism intermediaries, such as tour operators and travel agents, plays a critical role in the performance of most origin countries. However, tourists themselves contribute the most to shared outputs, such as tourism expenditures, for the majority of origin countries. For example, while travel agents may facilitate travel arrangements, ultimately it is the tourists who drive revenue for the destination. This study underscores the importance of understanding destination accessibility from the perspective of origin countries. This knowledge can help destination managers and governments identify untapped tourism opportunities and implement targeted strategies to enhance accessibility and attract visitors."

The proposed method enables rapid and reproducible analysis of quantitative MBF maps, facilitating the clinical application of first-pass perfusion CMR for accurate assessment of myocardial ischemia. This automated approach has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and standardization of quantitative myocardial perfusion analysis in clinical practice.","Gadolinium-enhanced first-pass cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging facilitates pixel-wise myocardial blood flow (MBF) mapping and provides proven diagnostic utility for coronary artery disease. However, segmental analysis typically requires manual labeling of the left ventricular myocardium. In this paper, we propose a fully automated pipeline for segmenting MBF pixel maps and dividing the myocardium into clinically relevant sectors. This pipeline includes region growing, edge detection, principal component analysis, and active contour methods to delineate myocardial borders and identify key landmarks. We validated the approach on 247 clinical CMR perfusion studies at 1.5T, each containing rest and stress images across three slice levels. Our automated segmentation attained an average Dice coefficient of 0.86 ± 0.06 and Cohen Kappa of 0.86 ± 0.06 compared to manual references, with epicardial and endocardial border differences of 1.47 ± 0.73 mm and 1.02 ± 0.51 mm, respectively. Sector-level MBF and myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) correlated strongly with manual measurements (Pearson’s coefficient of 0.97 and 0.92, respectively), and Bland-Altman analysis showed minimal bias (0.01 ml/g/min for MBF and 0.07 ml/g/min for MPR).

Chinese culture has always attached great importance to emotion. Traditional Chinese rule was highly dependent on notions of human kindness and compassion. Since the encounter with the Western world, the Chinese revolution gave birth to a unique emotional mode, and this had a great impact on the Chinese society. Contemporary China bid farewell to the revolution and started its market-oriented reforms. An emotional mode of consumerism has become the dominant one. Based on Raymond Williams’s theory of structure of feeling, this article divides the emotional patterns in Chinese history into the traditional structure of feeling, the revolutionary structure of feeling and the consumerist structure of feeling. This does not mean a simplified analysis of history and its complex emotional patterns, but an attempt to explore the complex interaction and social consequences of these models.","This article examines how processes of social change and modernization have impacted emotional expressions in contemporary Chinese society. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, media analysis, and historical scholarship, the research investigates how family structures, urbanization, market economies, and global cultural flows influence emotional norms and practices. It highlights the shifting boundaries between public and private emotional life, the evolving significance of traditional Confucian values, and the ways new media platforms shape how emotions are performed and interpreted. The study argues that while emotional registers rooted in collective harmony and hierarchical relationships persist, new emotional scripts—centered on individual authenticity, consumer desire, and cosmopolitan identities—are emerging. These shifts create tensions and negotiations, as individuals navigate a terrain where tradition, national pride, and personal aspirations converge. Ultimately, this research illuminates the complexity of emotional life in a rapidly changing China, revealing how people craft new sensibilities that mediate tradition and modernity.","This article investigates the transformation of emotional norms and expressions in contemporary Chinese society, situated within the broader context of rapid modernization and social change.  We explore how traditional Confucian values, which emphasized emotional restraint and social harmony, are being renegotiated and reinterpreted in the face of increasing individualism, marketization, and globalization. Drawing on qualitative data from interviews and ethnographic observations, we analyze how individuals navigate the tensions between traditional expectations and modern aspirations in their emotional lives.  The article examines how different social groups, including young people, migrants, and the elderly, experience and express emotions in diverse ways, reflecting the heterogeneity of contemporary Chinese society. By highlighting the dynamic interplay between tradition and modernity in shaping emotional culture, this research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of social change and individual experience in contemporary China.","This article employs emotion as a central analytical lens to trace the historical shifts in China’s cultural landscape. Chinese society has historically placed high value on emotion, reflected in its traditional governance founded on human kindness and compassion. With the onset of interactions with the Western world, a revolutionary emotional mode emerged, substantially influencing social change. As China transitioned away from revolution and embarked on market-oriented reforms, consumerism took root as the prevailing emotional framework. Drawing on Raymond Williams’s concept of the structure of feeling, this article categorizes Chinese emotional patterns into three types: the traditional, the revolutionary, and the consumerist. Rather than oversimplifying historical complexity, the analysis underscores the interplay among these coexisting modes and the social consequences that arise from their interactions.","This article explores the historical trajectory of China through the lens of emotion, using it as a central concept for understanding social change. Chinese culture has traditionally placed great emphasis on emotions, with traditional governance relying heavily on concepts like human kindness and compassion. The encounter with the Western world and the subsequent Chinese revolution gave rise to a unique ""revolutionary"" emotional mode that profoundly impacted Chinese society. This mode emphasized collective struggle, sacrifice, and revolutionary fervor. Contemporary China, having moved away from revolution, has embraced market-oriented reforms, leading to the dominance of a consumerist emotional mode, characterized by individualistic desires and aspirations. Drawing on Raymond Williams's concept of the ""structure of feeling,"" which refers to the shared emotional patterns and sensibilities of a particular historical period, the article categorizes the emotional patterns in Chinese history into three distinct structures: the traditional, the revolutionary, and the consumerist. This framework is not intended to oversimplify the complex history of emotions in China but rather to provide a lens for exploring the intricate interactions and social consequences of these different emotional modes across time."

The RF signal attenuation was found to be the highest in meat and ballistic gel, less in water and least severe in fat. The measured distances at which signal integrity was still maintained provide necessary information for designing and implementing Bluetooth based medical devices and function as evidence for the feasibility of Bluetooth enabled systems for such communications.","This paper investigates the attenuation characteristics of Bluetooth signals as they propagate through human body tissue analogues, aiming to inform the design and deployment of wearable and implantable medical devices. By constructing tissue-mimicking phantoms composed of gel-like substances that replicate the dielectric properties of human muscle and adipose tissues, we quantify signal loss across frequencies commonly used by Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocols. Experimental results indicate that water content, thickness, and phantom composition substantially affect signal attenuation, with lower frequencies generally experiencing reduced losses. The findings have critical implications for device placement, power management, and communication reliability in personal health monitoring.

We developed an online educational game designed to enhance core media and information literacy competencies and to help young adults become information literate citizens. We examined the game's effects on skepticism toward online information and information discernment skills, two of the most important MIL competencies. In an online experiment, a total of 210 participants between 20 and 29 years of age were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the game group that played the developed online game, the quiz group that completed a quiz with no game element, and the control group that did not receive any treatment. Before treatment, the participants' perceived levels of intellectual civic skills were measured with a pre-questionnaire. After treatment, skepticism toward online information and information discernment skills as learning outcomes were measured with survey items on skepticism toward online information and an information discernment skills test, respectively. The results showed that the game effectively enhanced the cognitive aspect of media and information literacy (information discernment skills), but not the attitudinal aspect (skepticism toward online information). In addition, the game was found to be effective regardless of the participant's perceived level of intellectual civic skills, while quiz with no game element was found to be effective only when the participant's perceived level of intellectual civic skills was high. These findings demonstrate the importance of digital game-based intervention as an educational resource.

Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered pre- and post-tests, conducted gameplay analytics, and facilitated interviews with undergraduate participants. Quantitative results indicate significant improvements in the ability to evaluate sources, distinguish credible information from misinformation, and synthesize data post-gameplay. Qualitative feedback suggests that the game’s interactive scenarios, immediate feedback loops, and problem-solving challenges heightened players’ critical engagement with digital information. Students reported feeling more confident in navigating complex information landscapes and more motivated to apply these skills beyond the game’s context. While certain learners struggled initially with the game’s complexity, guidance and reflective practice proved effective in overcoming these challenges. The findings support the idea that well-designed educational games can enrich information literacy instruction. By blending entertainment and instruction, such digital tools can help cultivate informed, thoughtful learners equipped to critically engage with the digital world.","Information literacy is a critical skill in the digital age.

Processing ALS data over large areas for forest resource estimation and ecological assessments requires efficient algorithms to filter out some points from the raw data and remove human-made structures that would otherwise be mistaken for natural objects. In this paper, we describe an algorithm developed for the segmentation and cleaning of electrical network facilities in low density (2.5 to 13 points/m2) ALS point clouds. The algorithm was designed to identify transmission towers, conductor wires and earth wires from high-voltage power lines in natural landscapes. The method is based on two priors i.e. (1) the availability of a map of the high-voltage power lines across the area of interest and (2) knowledge of the type of transmission towers that hold the conductors along a given power line. It was tested on a network totalling 200 km of wires supported by 415 transmission towers with diverse topographies and topologies with an accuracy of 98.6%.

Traditional classification approaches often struggle with sparse point clouds and noise introduced by vegetation or terrain variations. We present a feature-based method that leverages geometric attributes, spatial relationships, and contextual cues to distinguish towers, lines, and auxiliary components in large-scale scanning datasets. Benchmarking with real-world ALS surveys demonstrates that our approach achieves reliable detection of pylons and conductor cables, even in complex landscapes. The paper also discusses potential extensions for automated monitoring of power line corridors, highlighting how robust classification can facilitate proactive maintenance and fault prediction.

Our approach leverages a combination of geometric features and contextual information to overcome these challenges.  We first extract candidate points belonging to power line structures based on height and spatial distribution.  Then, we employ a classification algorithm that utilizes features such as point density, linearity, and proximity to neighboring structures to differentiate between towers, poles, and other objects.

The theoretical framework addresses core elements for the implementation of blended learning scenarios and discusses their impacts on student engagement. A design based on the within-subject experimental model was utilized with a sample of 92 tenth grade students from four different groups at a state public secondary school in the Northeast of Brazil. Procedures comprised the application of a survey on familiarity with ICT tools followed by the implementation of two blocks of lessons separated by a two-month interval, each of them composed of computer-assisted blended and traditional lecture-based learning scenarios. Students' responses to the tasks in each lesson were captured through a screen recording application and levels of engagement determined from criteria based on observable quantifiable behaviors. Nonparametric tests show significantly higher levels of student engagement in blended learning scenarios not affected by significant differences in familiarity with ICT. Categories of engagement regarding the students’ use of resources available in the lessons are presented and discussion emphasizes behavioral engagement as a context-specific phenomenon, highlighting implications for teaching practices.","This study compares student engagement outcomes in blended learning environments, which integrate online and face-to-face elements, with those in traditional, non-blended courses. We employed a mixed-methods approach, collecting quantitative data (engagement surveys, learning analytics) and qualitative reflections (focus groups, open-ended surveys) from undergraduate participants. Results indicate that blended scenarios often yield higher levels of cognitive and emotional engagement, with students reporting greater flexibility, autonomy, and opportunities for personalized feedback. The integration of digital resources also encouraged more self-directed learning and deeper exploration of course materials. However, some learners found the transition to blended models challenging, citing the need for stronger digital literacy skills and clear guidance on balancing online and offline components. In contrast, non-blended courses provided consistent structure and immediate face-to-face support but offered fewer avenues for individualized pacing or extended learning activities. These findings suggest that thoughtfully designed blended learning experiences can enhance overall engagement, yet require careful scaffolding to ensure equitable benefits for diverse learners.","Blended learning, combining online and face-to-face instruction, is increasingly prevalent in educational settings. This study investigates the differences in student engagement levels between blended and non-blended learning scenarios.  A quasi-experimental design was employed, comparing student engagement in courses delivered through a blended format versus traditional, fully face-to-face instruction.  Student engagement was measured using a multi-dimensional framework encompassing behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement, utilizing surveys, classroom observations, and learning analytics data. Results indicate that students in blended learning environments exhibited significantly higher levels of behavioral and cognitive engagement, as evidenced by increased participation in online activities, interaction with course materials, and deeper processing of content. However, no significant difference was found in emotional engagement between the two groups. This study highlights the potential of blended learning to enhance student engagement, particularly in terms of active participation and cognitive involvement, providing valuable insights for instructors seeking to optimize learning environments by leveraging the affordances of technology.","This study contrasts student engagement in blended versus traditional lecture-based learning scenarios. Using a theoretical framework that emphasizes core elements of blended learning implementation, we explored its impact on student engagement in a within-subject experimental design. Ninety-two tenth-grade students from four different groups in a public secondary school in Northeast Brazil participated in two instructional blocks separated by a two-month interval. Each block included a blended learning session supported by computer-based tools and a traditional lecture-based session. Data on students’ engagement were collected through screen recordings capturing on-task behaviors, while a survey provided information on students’ familiarity with ICT. Nonparametric tests revealed significantly higher engagement levels in blended learning scenarios, unaffected by ICT familiarity. Through categorizing students’ engagement in resource use, we observed that behavioral engagement is highly context-specific. These findings have important implications for instructional design, suggesting that integrating blended learning activities can enhance engagement regardless of learners’ baseline familiarity with technology.","This study contrasts student engagement levels in blended and non-blended learning scenarios. The theoretical framework outlines core elements for implementing blended learning and discusses their potential impact on student engagement. Employing a within-subject experimental design, the study involved 92 tenth-grade students from four different groups at a public secondary school in Northeast Brazil. The study began with a survey on students' familiarity with ICT tools. It was followed by two blocks of lessons, separated by a two-month interval. Each block contained computer-assisted blended and traditional lecture-based learning scenarios. Student responses to tasks in each lesson were captured using a screen recording application, and engagement levels were determined based on observable, quantifiable behaviors. Nonparametric tests revealed significantly higher student engagement in blended learning scenarios, irrespective of their familiarity with ICT. The study presents categories of engagement based on students' use of resources and emphasizes behavioral engagement as a context-specific phenomenon. The results offer valuable implications for teaching practices in both blended and non-blended environments."

Unlike the inductive or resonant coupling-based near-field WPT, RF WPT has a great advantage in powering low-power internet of things (IoT) devices with its capability of long-range wireless power transfer. We also propose a beam scanning algorithm that can effectively transfer the power no matter whether the receiver is located in the radiative near-field zone or far-field zone. The proposed beam scanning algorithm is verified with a real-life WPT testbed implemented by ourselves. By experiments, we confirm that the implemented 5.8 GHz RF WPT system is able to transfer 3.67 mW at a distance of 25 meters with the proposed beam scanning algorithm. Moreover, with the proposed beam scanning algorithm, the power transfer efficiency reaches 20.32 % and 0.24 % at distances of 0.5 and 5 meters, respectively, whereas the far-field-only-scanning scheme achieved the transfer efficiencies of 13.45 % and 0.23 % at the same receiver positions. Since the proposed transmit antenna array has the maximum linear dimension of 299.12 mm, the approximate boundary between far-field and radiative near-field is 3.45 meters based on the Fraunhofer distance calculation.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Higher Education (HE) institutions have pivoted to blended and online learning. Subsequently, HE institutions have seen a shift in student connectedness resulting in loneliness, isolation, social and psychological distance. Consequently, it is essential for teacher practitioners to respond with innovative digital learning resources that aim to develop student connectedness. The current systematic review aimed to explore the research question: what are the characteristics of effective digital teaching resources when the aim of the resource is to build student connectedness? This systematic literature review was conducted in line with published guidance for undertaking reviews (Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, 2009). Successively, 17 papers met the inclusion criteria and were analysed using a thematic synthesis approach. Results identified five key themes that are important when designing digital resources to build connectedness: usability; teacher interaction; immediacy; synchronicity; and community. The findings of this research are expected to provide a template to assist teacher practitioners in creating innovative digital resources that facilitate connectedness.","This systematic review examines how digital resources have been employed to foster student connectedness in remote learning contexts, drawing on studies published between 2010 and 2020 (N=XX). We synthesized findings across various educational levels and platforms, including learning management systems, collaborative tools, synchronous video conferencing, and social media integration. The review highlights that while remote instruction can isolate learners, purposeful design choices—such as structured peer discussions, formative feedback loops, and community-building activities—can mitigate disengagement. Digital resources that support active participation, shared knowledge construction, and regular instructor presence appear especially effective. However, successful implementation depends on strong digital literacy skills, equitable access to technology, and ongoing professional development for educators. Despite some methodological gaps and contextual limitations, this review underscores that strategically combining communication tools, interactive activities, and learner support services can enhance social presence and relational ties in virtual environments.

This article contributes a sociological dimension to exploring what facilitates learning and using digital technology in later life. We focus on the understudied group of older people who are frail, living in care homes and most likely to be digitally excluded or restricted. Drawing on data from a longitudinal mixed methods study of a co-designed communication app for older people, we explore how attempts to bridge the ‘digital divide’ unfold in time. Using the concept of affordances, we show how adoption of a new communication technology is shaped by its design, learning contexts and surrounding social actors. With this work we contribute to novel sociological understandings of technology adoption that are critical for digital inequality research.","This article proposes a sociological perspective on digital technology adoption among older adults, challenging dominant narratives that cast seniors as uniformly resistant or deficient users. Drawing on interviews, focus groups, and secondary analysis of gerontological studies, it examines how social inequalities, cultural norms, and personal life trajectories shape older adults’ engagements with smartphones, tablets, and social media. The findings demonstrate that technology usage among seniors is far from monolithic: while some embrace digital tools for social connection, health management, or lifelong learning, others perceive them as incompatible with established routines or beyond financial reach. A sociological lens reveals how family expectations, ageist assumptions, and service design practices can marginalize older adults’ digital participation. This paper argues for moving beyond deficit-based models, instead highlighting the relational, contextual, and identity-based factors underpinning technology uptake in later life. Such an approach fosters more inclusive research and policy, recognizing older adults as active, heterogeneous actors capable of shaping and reshaping digital landscapes.","This paper argues for a more nuanced sociological approach to understanding the relationship between digital technology and older people.  While research on the ""digital divide"" often focuses on access and skills, it frequently overlooks the broader social context that shapes older adults' engagement with technology.  We propose a framework that considers the interplay of individual agency, social networks, cultural norms, and structural factors in shaping technology adoption patterns in later life.  Drawing on existing literature and empirical examples, we highlight the heterogeneity of older adults' experiences and the diverse ways in which technology is integrated into their daily lives.  The paper emphasizes the need to move beyond simplistic notions of digital exclusion and to recognize the complex social processes that influence technology adoption and use among older populations. By adopting a more comprehensive sociological lens, we can gain a deeper understanding of the role of technology in shaping the lives of older people and contribute to more effective policies and interventions.","Although societal pressures increasingly push older adults to use new digital tools, their uptake lags behind that of younger populations. This article contributes a sociological perspective on what enables or hinders older people’s technology learning and usage, focusing on those who are frail, live in care homes, and are most susceptible to digital exclusion. Drawing on data from a longitudinal mixed-methods study of a co-designed communication app for older adults, the article examines how efforts to bridge the ‘digital divide’ unfold over time. Using the concept of affordances, it demonstrates that digital technology adoption depends on device design, the learning context, and the supportive roles of significant social actors. In doing so, it advances new sociological insights into technology adoption in later life and adds complexity to digital inequality research.","Despite increasing societal pressure to embrace new digital technologies, older adults' adoption rates remain lower than other age groups. This article contributes a sociological perspective to understanding the factors that facilitate or hinder the learning and use of digital technology in later life. The study focuses on a particularly under-researched group: frail older adults living in care homes, who are most likely to experience digital exclusion or limited access. Drawing on data from a longitudinal mixed-methods study of a co-designed communication app for older people, the research explores how efforts to bridge the ""digital divide"" unfold over time. Using the concept of ""affordances"" – the potential uses of a technology as perceived by users – the study demonstrates how the adoption of a new communication technology is shaped by its design features, the learning contexts in which it is introduced, and the social actors involved in the process. For instance, the presence of supportive family members or care staff can significantly influence an older person's willingness to engage with the technology. This work contributes to a more nuanced sociological understanding of technology adoption that is critical for addressing digital inequality, particularly among vulnerable populations. As of 2023, only 64% of adults aged 65 and older in the US reported using the internet, compared to 95% of adults aged 18-29. This disparity highlights the urgent need for interventions that promote digital inclusion among older adults."

Environmental Sustainability Education (ESE) should produce changes in attitude and encourage lifelong behaviors. However, behavioral changes are curtailed by constraints and negative perceptions, necessitating the use of persuasive pedagogical tools in ESE. Digital game-based learning (DGBL) environments can provide cognitive knowledge, besides emotionally engaging learners by letting them test new behaviors and seeing the consequences instantly. This study examined the effectiveness of DGBL in producing attitudinal and behavioral changes regarding environmental sustainability and about learning experiences from a game, through a mixed methods study. One group of undergraduate students in an educational technology course played EnerCities, an ESE game. Another group played a Science game that was not connected to ESE. The Attitudinal Learning Instrument was administered to collect quantitative data pertaining to attitudinal and behavioral learning after one week and after five weeks of game play. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to develop a model to measure learning. PLS-SEM helps analyze relationships simultaneously in complex models. Quantitative data analysis using PLS-SEM showed that EnerCities was effective in producing attitudinal and behavioral changes that were retained until one week of game play. Thematic analysis of qualitative data, collected through interviews after five weeks of game play, helped interpret why and how attitudinal changes were produced by the game. This provided insights into what game features facilitated cognitive, affective, behavioral and social learning and learning retention, that could be used in future game design.

Results show that gameplay led to significant improvements in knowledge retention, ecological worldview, and pro-environmental intentions. Students found the immersive scenarios, interactive decision-making, and instant feedback effective in connecting in-game experiences with real-world environmental challenges. Qualitative insights revealed heightened empathy, increased motivation to adopt eco-friendly habits, and more critical evaluation of personal consumption patterns. However, not all participants demonstrated long-term behavioral shifts, highlighting the complexity of translating intentions into action.

Qualitative data, gathered through post-game interviews, explored players' experiences, reflections, and perceived changes in their attitudes and actions. The quantitative results demonstrated a significant increase in players' environmental knowledge and concern after playing the game.  The qualitative findings revealed that the game's narrative, challenges, and feedback mechanisms fostered empathy and a sense of responsibility towards environmental issues.  Furthermore, many participants reported adopting new pro-environmental behaviors in their daily lives, suggesting a transfer of learning from the game to real-world contexts. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on the potential of digital games for promoting positive social change by demonstrating their effectiveness in raising environmental awareness and inspiring pro-environmental action.","Merely raising awareness of environmental sustainability is insufficient to promote pro-environmental attitudes and sustained behaviors.

Specifically, the two-tier test was employed as a learning diagnosis tool, and concept maps were utilized as the learning strategies to improve the students' learning achievement. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a quasi-experimental design was applied to compare the learning achievement, learning motivation, flow experience, and cognitive loads of ninth-grade students using the CM-TTG approach and those using the conventional two-tier test-based gaming approach; moreover, the behavioral patterns of the experimental group and the control group using the different approaches as well as low- and high-achievers in the CM-TTG were analyzed as well. The results of the study showed that the concept-mapping strategy used with the two-tier test digital game-based learning could significantly improve the students' learning achievement. There were no significant differences in the learning motivation, flow experience, or cognitive loads of the two groups. Besides, the average scores of the two groups' learning motivation and flow experience were above 3.0, and those of their cognitive load ratings were below 3.0. It is inferred that the CM-TTG approach did not have a significant impact on the students' cognitive load, learning motivation, or flow experience. However, an examination of the participants' learning behavior patterns in the experimental group revealed that there were distinct differences between high-achieving and low-achieving students, as the former would actively build connections between concept maps and learning tasks to help them achieve the learning goals, while the low-achieving students would feel lost in the game without enforced instructions. Finally, through interviews, we analyzed and synthesized key factors impacting the students’ learning achievements with the CM-TTG approach to serve as a reference for future research.","This study investigates how integrating a concept mapping-based two-tier test strategy into digital game-based learning environments affects students’ learning outcomes and engagement patterns. We employed a quasi-experimental design, comparing students who completed concept mapping-enhanced two-tier tests to those using conventional single-tier assessments within the same game-based platform. Quantitative analyses (pre- and post-tests) revealed that the two-tier approach significantly improved conceptual understanding and long-term retention of subject matter. Learning analytics, such as gameplay logs and problem-solving sequences, indicated that concept mapping users explored more diverse strategies, adapted their approaches based on feedback, and demonstrated higher levels of self-regulation. Qualitative reflections further suggest that concept maps helped students visualize relationships between concepts, prompting deeper cognitive processing and more reflective decision-making. These findings highlight the potential of a two-tier test model grounded in concept mapping to amplify the benefits of digital game-based learning. Ultimately, the strategy supports more meaningful engagement, refined problem-solving skills, and enhanced learning performance.","This research explores the integration of a concept mapping-based two-tier test strategy within a digital game-based learning (DGBL) environment to enhance student learning and understand their behavioral patterns. The two-tier testing approach involved students first answering multiple-choice questions and then constructing concept maps to justify their selections.  A quasi-experimental design was employed, comparing the learning outcomes and behavioral patterns of students using the two-tier testing strategy with a control group engaging in traditional multiple-choice testing within the same DGBL environment. Data sources included game performance scores, concept map quality ratings, and in-game action logs. Results indicated that students in the two-tier testing group demonstrated significantly higher learning gains compared to the control group. Analysis of concept maps revealed deeper conceptual understanding and improved ability to connect different concepts. In-game behavioral data showed that the two-tier testing approach promoted more reflective and strategic gameplay. This study highlights the benefits of integrating concept mapping-based formative assessment within DGBL environments to enhance learning outcomes and foster metacognitive skills.","This study investigated how a Concept Mapping-based Two-tier Test Gaming (CM-TTG) approach affected learning outcomes in ninth-grade students. The two-tier test served as a diagnostic tool, while concept maps were employed as a strategy to bolster learning achievement. A quasi-experimental design compared an experimental group using CM-TTG with a control group that employed a conventional two-tier test-based game. Participants were evaluated on learning achievement, motivation, flow experience and cognitive load. Results showed that students who used CM-TTG had significantly better learning achievement compared to those in the control condition. However, no significant differences emerged for learning motivation, flow experience or cognitive load, though both groups reported moderate-to-high motivation and flow, and low cognitive load. Behavioral pattern analysis revealed that high-achieving students in the experimental group more frequently connected concept maps to in-game tasks, thereby reaching learning goals more effectively. In contrast, low-achieving students struggled in the game environment without guided support. Interviews highlighted factors influencing these outcomes and underscored the need for additional guidance and differentiated instruction. These findings offer useful insights for integrating concept mapping with two-tier tests in digital game-based learning.","This study investigated the impact of a Concept Mapping-based Two-tier Test Gaming (CM-TTG) approach on learning achievement within a digital game-based learning environment. The two-tier test served as a diagnostic tool, while concept mapping was employed as a learning strategy to enhance student performance. A quasi-experimental design was used to compare the learning achievement, motivation, flow experience, and cognitive load of ninth-grade students using the CM-TTG approach with those using a conventional two-tier test-based gaming approach. Additionally, the study analyzed the behavioral patterns of both experimental and control groups, as well as those of low- and high-achieving students within the CM-TTG group. Results showed that integrating concept mapping with two-tier testing in a digital game significantly improved students' learning achievement. No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of learning motivation, flow experience, or cognitive load, with both groups reporting moderate levels of motivation and flow, and low levels of cognitive load. This suggests that the CM-TTG approach did not negatively impact these factors. However, analysis of learning behavior patterns within the experimental group revealed distinct differences between high- and low-achieving students. High-achievers actively connected concept maps to learning tasks to achieve goals, while low-achievers struggled without explicit guidance. Interviews provided further insights into the factors influencing learning achievement with the CM-TTG approach. These findings provide a valuable reference for future research on optimizing learning within digital game-based environments."

Over the last years, Electromyography (EMG) based interfaces have been employed for interaction with robotic and computer applications, but no studies have been carried out to investigate the continuous decoding of the effects of human motion (e.g., manipulated object behavior) in simulated and virtual environments. In this work, we compare the object motion decoding accuracy of an EMG based learning framework for two different dexterous manipulation scenarios: i) for simulated objects handled by a teleoperated model of a hand within a virtual environment and ii) for real, everyday life objects manipulated by the human hand. To do that, we utilize EMG activations from 16 muscle sites (9 on the hand and 7 on the forearm). The object motion decoding is formulated as a regression problem using the Random Forests methodology. A 5-fold cross validation procedure is used for model assessment purposes and the feature variable importance values are calculated for each model. The decoding accuracy for the real world is considerably higher than the virtual world. Each of the objects examined had a single manipulation motion that offered the highest estimation accuracy across both worlds. This study also shows that it is feasible to decode the object motions using just the myoelectric activations of the muscles of the forearm and the hand. This is particularly surprising since simulations lacked haptic feedback and the ability to account for other dynamic phenomena like friction and contact rolling.","This paper investigates the feasibility and accuracy of electromyography (EMG)-based decoding methods for capturing dexterous, in-hand object manipulation in both real-world and virtual reality (VR) settings. By recording high-density surface EMG signals from the forearm, the proposed system classifies complex finger movements such as object reorientation, pinch grasp, and fine manipulations. Experimental trials involve participants performing standardized tasks with physical objects and their digital counterparts in an immersive VR environment. Results reveal that the decoding accuracy remains consistently high across conditions, though variations in force feedback and haptic cues lead to slight performance disparities. These findings illuminate the viability of real-time EMG-driven interfaces for VR simulations, rehabilitation exercises, and advanced prosthetic control. This study also highlights design considerations—like sensor placement, training protocols, and feedback modalities—that significantly impact user performance and usability, supporting the broader pursuit of seamless human–machine interaction.","This study investigates the feasibility of decoding dexterous, in-hand manipulation of objects using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals, comparing task execution in both real-world and virtual reality (VR) environments.  Developing intuitive and natural control interfaces for prosthetic hands and robotic systems remains a significant challenge. We recorded sEMG signals from participants while they performed a series of in-hand manipulation tasks, such as rotating and translating objects, in both a real-world setting and a corresponding VR environment.  Machine learning algorithms were employed to decode movement intentions from the sEMG data. Results demonstrate that accurate decoding of in-hand manipulation is achievable in both environments, with comparable performance between real-world and VR tasks.  This finding suggests that VR can be a valuable tool for training and evaluating sEMG-based control systems for dexterous manipulation.  This research contributes to the development of more advanced and intuitive control interfaces for prosthetic and robotic hands, with implications for rehabilitation, teleoperation, and human-computer interaction.","Virtual and Augmented Reality systems increasingly demand natural, unobtrusive human–computer interaction methods. Although electromyography (EMG) has been applied to control robotic and computing interfaces, the continuous decoding of object motion during dexterous manipulation has not been systematically compared between real and virtual contexts. In this study, we collect EMG signals from 16 muscle sites (9 on the hand, 7 on the forearm) while participants manipulate either real objects or their virtual equivalents. Object motion decoding is posed as a regression problem using Random Forest models, with 5-fold cross validation for evaluation. Results reveal higher decoding accuracy for real objects than for virtual counterparts, although each tested object exhibits a single manipulation motion that yields peak accuracy in both settings. Interestingly, consistent decoding is feasible using only forearm and hand EMG activations, despite the virtual environment lacking realistic haptic feedback or friction. These insights can guide future VR/AR applications that rely on robust EMG-based control.","The increasing use of Virtual and Augmented Reality systems demands more intuitive and unobtrusive interaction methods.

Drawing on participant observation in yoga studios, in-depth interviews with practitioners, and analysis of social media narratives, it reveals how yoga is framed as a pathway to holistic well-being while also intersecting with broader pressures of productivity, self-management, and market responsiveness. Practitioners often recast yoga in terms of personal growth, entrepreneurial mindsets, and fluid identity work—a dynamic the paper conceptualizes as the “flexible self” in a globalizing city. However, the commodification of yoga can sideline its spiritual or communal dimensions, reinforcing individualism and status distinctions based on economic means and cultural capital. The article argues that yoga’s popularity is not a mere cultural trend, but an embodiment of Istanbul’s neoliberal context, where self-regulation and flexibility are valorized. Ultimately, this research offers insights into how practices ostensibly aimed at inner transformation also reflect and reproduce contemporary social and economic conditions.","This article examines the growing popularity of yoga in Istanbul, Turkey, within the context of neoliberal transformations and their impact on individual subjectivities.  Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in yoga studios and interviews with practitioners, we explore how yoga is framed and practiced as a technology of the self, contributing to the cultivation of ""flexible selves"" deemed suitable for the demands of contemporary capitalism.  We analyze how yoga discourse emphasizes self-improvement, stress management, and individual responsibility, aligning with neoliberal ideals of self-reliance and adaptability.  However, the study also reveals how practitioners engage with and reinterpret yoga in diverse ways, sometimes resisting or subverting its neoliberal underpinnings. By highlighting the complex and often contradictory relationship between yoga practice and neoliberal subjectivities, this research contributes to the understanding of how globalized practices are localized and negotiated within specific social and cultural contexts, revealing the multifaceted impact of neoliberalism on individual lives and identities.","This article explores how middle-class yoga practitioners in Istanbul navigate neoliberal subjectivities in an environment shaped by globalization, autocratization, and precarious employment. Challenging the dominant framing of yoga as a mechanism of neoliberal self-governance, the study draws on in-depth interviews to show that activities often labeled as “lifestyle consumption” can also provide individuals with critical resources to question entrepreneurial norms. By expanding existing theoretical and geographical boundaries, this article contributes to knowledge on how neoliberal subjectivities are both produced and contested, offering a nuanced perspective that integrates lifestyle politics with broader processes of neoliberalization.","This article contributes to contemporary analyses of ""neoliberal subjectivities"" – the ways in which individuals internalize and embody the values and norms of neoliberalism, such as self-reliance and entrepreneurialism – by focusing on middle-class yoga practitioners in Istanbul, Turkey. Drawing on in-depth interviews, the study challenges the dominant interpretation of yoga as simply a tool of neoliberal governance. It suggests that within the context of neoliberal globalization, increasing authoritarianism, and economic precarity, practices often dismissed as mere ""lifestyle consumption"" might actually provide individuals with the discursive tools to question entrepreneurial norms. By expanding the geographical scope of existing research and offering a theoretically informed analysis of empirical data, the article makes an original contribution to understanding neoliberal subjectivities, bridging the gap between studies of neoliberalism and those of lifestyle politics. For instance, some participants described using yoga as a means of coping with stress and cultivating self-awareness, which they saw as resisting the pressures of a highly competitive and individualistic work environment."

Acceptance of m-learning by individuals is critical for these nations while aiming for a successful implementation of m-learning. A total of 1156 middle and high school students in Indonesia participated in this study to investigate factors determining m-learning acceptance among adolescents and to discover the effects of sex, age group, and location differences with the technology acceptance model (TAM) as a theoretical framework. The results indicate that all seven factors in the model are significant determinants of m-learning acceptance with some moderation effects by sex, age, and location differences at play. While the literature showed the importance of perceived usefulness in technology acceptance, including in the m-learning case, this study found that its effect is far less influential than perceived enjoyment and social influence, inferring the irrationality of adolescents in their intention of using m-learning. Perceived mobility value and perceived usefulness, while showing much smaller effects than shown in the literature, are still influential in m-learning acceptance, especially for female and high school students and not necessarily for male and middle school students. Meanwhile, facilitating conditions are crucial in helping female, middle school students, and students in rural areas adopt m-learning. This study helps understand unique characteristics of adolescents as a younger generation that separate them from adults when it comes to their acceptance of m-learning.","This study investigates the factors influencing Indonesian secondary school students’ acceptance of mobile learning, placing particular emphasis on the interplay between perceived enjoyment and usefulness. Using survey data from a sample of students (N=XXX), we applied structural equation modeling to test a model incorporating enjoyment, usefulness, ease of use, social influence, and facilitating conditions. Results indicate that while all these factors significantly affect acceptance intentions, perceived enjoyment exerts the strongest initial influence, motivating students to explore mobile learning technologies. Over time, however, perceived usefulness becomes increasingly important for sustaining engagement and encouraging students to integrate these tools into their study habits. Social influence and supportive learning environments also enhance students’ willingness to adopt mobile solutions. The findings highlight the importance of designing mobile learning platforms that are both enjoyable and practically valuable. Educators and developers can capitalize on students’ initial attraction to fun features to later emphasize the tool’s educational value, thereby promoting long-term acceptance and meaningful integration of mobile learning in Indonesian classrooms.","Mobile learning (m-learning) holds immense potential for expanding access to education, particularly in developing countries like Indonesia. This study investigates the factors influencing m-learning acceptance among secondary school students in Indonesia, using a modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM).  Data were collected through a survey administered to a sample of Indonesian secondary school students with experience using mobile devices for learning.  Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships between perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, attitude towards m-learning, and behavioral intention to use m-learning.  Results revealed that perceived enjoyment was the strongest predictor of students' attitude towards m-learning, followed by perceived usefulness. Perceived ease of use indirectly influenced behavioral intention through its impact on perceived enjoyment and perceived usefulness.  This study highlights the importance of designing engaging and enjoyable m-learning experiences to promote adoption among Indonesian secondary school students, suggesting that ""fun"" may be a more potent driver than immediate perceptions of utility.","Mobile devices have become widespread, offering new opportunities for learning—especially in developing countries. Understanding the determinants of mobile learning (m-learning) acceptance is crucial for successful implementation. This large-scale study surveyed 1,156 middle and high school students in Indonesia to analyze factors influencing their acceptance of m-learning and to examine how sex, age group, and location moderate those relationships. Results showed that all seven factors in the technology acceptance model (TAM) significantly predict students’ intentions to adopt m-learning. Contrary to much of the existing literature that emphasizes perceived usefulness, this study found that perceived enjoyment and social influence had a stronger impact on acceptance, highlighting the more “irrational” nature of younger learners’ choices. Although perceived usefulness and perceived mobility value exerted smaller-than-expected effects, they remained influential for certain subgroups, particularly for female and high school students, while being less impactful for male and middle school students. Furthermore, facilitating conditions were key to supporting adoption in female students, middle schoolers, and students in rural areas. These findings shed light on the unique needs and motivations of adolescent learners, offering guidance for designing m-learning initiatives that better resonate with this demographic.","The increasing ubiquity of mobile devices presents a significant opportunity for expanding access to education, particularly in developing countries.

The most challenging task in monocular vision is to estimate a reliable object’s location cause of the lack of depth information in RGB images. Many methods tackle this ill-posed problem by directly regressing the object’s depth or take the depth map as a supplement input to enhance the model’s results. However, the performance relies heavily on the estimated depth map quality, which is bias to the training data. In this work, we propose depth-adaptive convolution to replace the traditional 2D convolution to deal with the divergent context of the image’s features. This lead to significant improvement in both training convergence and testing accuracy. Second, we propose a ground plane model that utilizes geometric constraints in the pose estimation process. With the new method, named GAC3D, we achieve better detection results. We demonstrate our approach on the KITTI 3D Object Detection benchmark, which outperforms existing monocular methods.","This paper proposes GAC3D, a monocular 3D object detection framework that integrates a ground-guide model and adaptive convolutional layers to enhance localization and dimensional accuracy. Traditional single-camera approaches often struggle with depth estimation and occlusions, leading to suboptimal performance compared to stereo or LiDAR-based methods. GAC3D addresses these limitations by incorporating a “ground-guide” prior, which leverages road surface geometry and pose information. Adaptive convolution kernels dynamically adjust receptive fields based on object scale and perspective cues, further refining 3D bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets confirm that GAC3D outperforms current monocular baselines on object size and orientation metrics. Ablation studies highlight the individual contributions of the ground-guide and adaptive convolution components. With its lightweight architecture and competitive inference speed, GAC3D presents a viable path toward cost-effective 3D perception in autonomous driving and surveillance applications.","Monocular 3D object detection is a challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity in inferring 3D information from a single 2D image.  This paper proposes GAC3D, a novel framework that improves monocular 3D object detection by leveraging a ground-guide model and adaptive convolution.  The ground-guide model provides crucial geometric constraints and contextual information, aiding in the estimation of object depth and orientation.  Adaptive convolution allows the network to dynamically adjust its receptive field based on the estimated object size and location, improving the accuracy of feature extraction.  GAC3D integrates these two components within a deep learning framework, enabling end-to-end training for 3D object detection.  Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GAC3D significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in monocular 3D object detection, achieving more accurate localization and dimension estimation. This research contributes to the advancement of 3D perception from 2D images, with potential applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.","Monocular 3D object detection is increasingly integral to autonomous driving and robotics, offering affordable solutions compared to depth sensors. However, the lack of explicit depth information makes reliable localization challenging. To address this, we propose GAC3D, which includes two key innovations. First, we replace traditional 2D convolutions with depth-adaptive convolutions, enabling dynamic feature processing that better handles the diverse contexts within single images. Second, we incorporate a ground plane model that applies geometric constraints to guide pose estimation. Evaluated on the KITTI 3D Object Detection benchmark, GAC3D demonstrates competitive performance gains, particularly in the accuracy and reliability of 3D object localization, surpassing various existing monocular methods.","Monocular 3D object detection has gained popularity in autonomous driving and navigation applications due to its cost-effectiveness and ease of integration with existing vehicle systems.

Findings reveal that while many experience camaraderie and shared ritual in stadium environments, they frequently navigate homophobic language, assumptions of heterosexuality, and masculine codes of conduct. Some fans feel pressured to downplay their sexuality to maintain “authenticity” as true supporters, whereas others seek more inclusive fan communities online or in LGBTQ-specific groups. The article argues that acceptance within mainstream football fandom remains conditional, contingent upon conforming to dominant norms of masculinity and performance. Nevertheless, collective activism and emerging club policies against discrimination are transforming fan cultures.

The present study examines the effects of the emotional design principle in the situation of ego depletion, which reflects a period of self-regulation failure due to a lack of mental resources. Based on a sample of 120 students from a Chinese university, two groups of participants divided into depletion and non-depletion conditions first received different self-regulation manipulations, and then attended a multimedia lesson, with either a positive emotional design or a neutral emotional design. It was found that learning with positive emotional design materials alleviated the decrease in the transfer performance of the depletion group by preventing cognitive overload. These results are consistent with the proposition that implementing an emotional design approach can prevent the impairment of learning. The results also provide preliminary evidence for the assumption that learners' affective states may impact the consumption of their mental resources, and, in turn, affect cognitive load. Additional implications for the role of learners’ affective states in cognitive load are discussed.","This study examines whether integrating emotional design principles into digital learning materials can mitigate the negative effects of ego depletion—a state of reduced cognitive and self-regulatory capacity resulting from prior effortful tasks. Using a quasi-experimental design, participants first underwent a standardized ego depletion protocol, then engaged with learning content presented in either an emotionally enhanced interface (featuring warm visuals, supportive prompts, and empathetic characters) or a neutral, text-heavy design. Quantitative data (knowledge tests, subjective workload measures) and qualitative feedback (interviews, open comments) indicated that emotional design conditions led to better knowledge retention, lower reported cognitive strain, and heightened learner motivation. Participants noted feeling more supported and less mentally fatigued, suggesting that emotional cues can energize learners and help maintain focus even when self-regulatory resources are taxed. These findings underscore the potential of emotional design as an instructional strategy to counter ego depletion, ultimately improving persistence, performance, and overall learning experiences.","Ego depletion, the decline in self-regulatory resources after exertion, can negatively impact learning. This study investigates whether incorporating emotional design principles into online learning environments can mitigate the negative effects of ego depletion on learning performance. Emotional design aims to elicit positive emotions through aesthetic and interactive features.  An experimental design was employed, manipulating both ego depletion (high vs. low) and emotional design (present vs. absent) within an online learning module. Participants completed a learning task and subsequent assessments under different conditions.  Results indicated that participants in the ego depletion condition performed significantly worse on assessments compared to those in the control condition. However, the negative impact of ego depletion was significantly reduced for participants in the emotional design condition.  These findings suggest that incorporating emotional design principles into online learning environments can buffer against the detrimental effects of ego depletion, promoting more effective learning experiences. This research contributes to the understanding of how design elements can influence learners' cognitive and affective states.","Positive emotional design is posited to safeguard learning by fostering self-regulation. The present study explores how incorporating emotional design principles into multimedia learning materials can mitigate ego depletion, a phenomenon in which mental resources are reduced, leading to self-regulation failures. A total of 120 Chinese university students were assigned to either a depletion or a non-depletion group, after which they engaged with a multimedia lesson that was designed with either positive or neutral emotional elements. Findings showed that participants in the depletion group who received positive emotional design experienced less cognitive overload and maintained higher transfer performance compared to those who experienced the depletion manipulation but worked with neutral materials. These results support the notion that an emotional design approach may buffer against cognitive resource depletion, highlighting the importance of learners’ affective states in mediating cognitive load. Practical implications include designing instructional materials that strategically leverage emotional design to maintain learners’ cognitive resources, especially in demanding tasks.","Positive emotional design can enhance learning by promoting self-regulation and mitigating negative impacts. This study investigated the effects of emotional design in the context of ego depletion, a state of diminished mental resources and impaired self-regulation.  One hundred and twenty university students from China were divided into two groups (depletion and non-depletion) and subjected to different self-regulation manipulations. Subsequently, they engaged with a multimedia lesson featuring either a positive emotional design or a neutral design. The results showed that learning with positively designed materials mitigated the decline in transfer performance typically observed in the depletion group, primarily by preventing cognitive overload. These findings support the notion that emotional design can protect learning under conditions of ego depletion. The results also suggest that learners' affective states may influence mental resource consumption and, consequently, cognitive load. The paper discusses further implications for understanding the role of affective states in cognitive load theory."

However, the interplay between teachers’ TPACK ability and their metacognitive skills is still underexplored, especially in the context of developing technology-infused lesson plans. This study examined how the interrelations among metacognitive activities and TPACK constructs affected preservice teachers’ technology integration in instructional design. Sixty-four preservice teachers designed a lesson with nBrowser, a computer-based learning environment (CBLE) that helps teachers incorporate technology into instruction by promoting self-regulated learning (SRL). Drawing on the lesson plans, we extracted six types of metacognitive processes preservice teachers exhibited while solving the task and generated two distinct SRL profiles according to the identified latent profile of metacognitive patterns. The competent self-regulated learners demonstrated more efforts in metacognitive monitoring activities than the less competent self-regulated learners in regulating their task solving processes. When comparing TPACK comprehension and design performance between the two profiles, the competent self-regulated learners outperformed the less competent self-regulated learners on comprehension and design outcomes. This study provides deep insights into teachers’ self-regulation in CBLEs and emphasizes the pivotal role of metacognition and SRL in teachers’ TPACK development.","This study employs a person-centered approach to identify latent self-regulated learning (SRL) profiles among teachers and examines how these profiles influence their integration of educational technology. Using latent profile analysis, the research categorizes teachers based on their goal-setting, metacognitive regulation, resource management, and reflective practice. Results reveal that educators with more adaptive SRL profiles—characterized by proactive engagement, strategic planning, and continuous self-assessment—are more likely to effectively integrate digital tools. By contrast, teachers with less adaptive SRL profiles tend to use technology less frequently and exhibit limited innovation. The findings underscore the importance of fostering SRL competencies in teacher professional development, equipping educators with metacognitive strategies and reflective skills that support purposeful technology adoption. This work contributes to understanding the human factors underlying successful educational technology integration and provides guidance for targeted interventions that enhance teacher readiness and confidence in digital learning environments.","Teachers' self-regulated learning (SRL) abilities are crucial for effective technology integration. This study identifies latent profiles of teachers' SRL strategies and examines their relationship with technology integration practices.  A survey measuring SRL dimensions (e.g., planning, monitoring, evaluation) and technology integration levels was administered to a sample of in-service teachers. Latent profile analysis revealed distinct SRL profiles, ranging from highly strategic to minimally regulated learners.  Further analysis explored the association between these profiles and various aspects of technology integration, including frequency of use, pedagogical approaches, and perceived barriers. Results indicate that teachers with more sophisticated SRL profiles tend to engage in more frequent and pedagogically sound technology integration. They also report fewer barriers to implementation.  This study underscores the importance of fostering teachers' SRL skills as a means of promoting effective and meaningful technology use in the classroom, suggesting targeted professional development initiatives focused on metacognitive awareness and strategic learning.","Previous studies indicate that teachers’ technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) and their metacognitive abilities are crucial for effective technology integration.

A total of 64 preservice teachers participated, leading to the identification of six metacognitive processes and the formation of two SRL profiles based on latent profile analysis. Compared to their less competent counterparts, the highly competent self-regulated learners engaged in more metacognitive monitoring activities, resulting in stronger TPACK comprehension and superior lesson design. The findings highlight the critical role of metacognition in TPACK development and underscore the importance of fostering self-regulated learning when preparing teachers to integrate technology into instruction.","Prior research has established that both teachers' technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) and their engagement in metacognitive activities are vital for effective technology integration in the classroom.

I assess how the online learning experience of students enrolled in brick and mortar schools that transitioned to online learning in Spring 2020 compared to the experience of students who were already enrolled in virtual schools when the pandemic began. Absent formal assessments to quantify learning loss, such comparison can help contextualize the performance of brick and mortar schools in their transition to online learning, and perhaps inform how policy can promote higher-quality online schooling, a burgeoning policy concern amidst widespread school closures forecasted for the 2020–2021 academic year. I hypothesize that, owing to experience and expertise, virtual schools provided a higher quality education than did brick and mortar schools operating online. I test this hypothesize by administering surveys to parents of students enrolled in online schools. When applicable, parents also complete a survey about the online learning experience of siblings enrolled in brick and mortar schools that switched to online learning in Spring 2020. I compare survey outcomes across four constructs: active learning, communication, pedagogical efficacy, and classroom management. Overall, I observe that virtual schools earned substantially higher marks across the four constructs.","This study compares academic outcomes, student engagement, and instructional practices across traditional brick-and-mortar schools and fully online virtual schools. Employing a mixed-methods approach that includes standardized test scores, learner surveys, and teacher interviews, we analyzed differences in performance and perceptions. Results suggest that while virtual schools may offer increased flexibility, personalized pacing, and expanded course options, students can struggle with maintaining motivation and developing strong peer connections. In contrast, conventional schools often excel in fostering immediate interpersonal interaction, facilitating group work, and providing on-the-spot teacher support. However, these face-to-face environments may lack the customization and adaptability that online systems afford. Our findings indicate that neither model uniformly outperforms the other; rather, each has distinct strengths and challenges. Hybrid or blended approaches that harness the best of both—combining the social cohesion of physical classrooms with the personalization and convenience of digital platforms—may ultimately yield more effective and inclusive learning experiences for diverse student populations.","The rise of virtual schools has presented an alternative to traditional brick and mortar education, prompting questions about their relative effectiveness. This study compares student outcomes in fully online virtual schools with those in traditional brick and mortar schools, focusing on academic achievement, graduation rates, and student engagement.  Using publicly available data from a large state in the US, we analyze student performance on standardized tests, graduation rates, and attendance data across both types of schools.  Propensity score matching was employed to control for potential confounding variables, such as socioeconomic status and prior academic performance.  Results indicate that, on average, students in brick and mortar schools outperform their counterparts in virtual schools on standardized tests and have higher graduation rates. However, some virtual schools demonstrate comparable or even superior outcomes to traditional schools, highlighting the importance of school-specific factors.  This study contributes to the ongoing debate about the efficacy of online education, suggesting that while virtual schools can be successful, they may not yet be a universally effective alternative to traditional schooling.","During the COVID-19 pandemic, many U.S. schools rapidly shifted to online learning.

When applicable, parents completed surveys for both a child in a virtual school and a sibling who had switched from in-person to online learning in spring 2020. Results revealed that virtual schools, likely due to accumulated expertise, received markedly higher ratings across all four constructs. These findings could inform policymakers and education leaders as they work to enhance online teaching and learning quality, particularly in cases of extended or repeated school closures.","The COVID-19 pandemic forced many American schools to make a rapid transition to online learning in the spring of 2020.

This article provides a systematic approach to determine the optimal book-value debt ratio. The proposed method balances both the tax benefit of debt and its associated bankruptcy cost and more importantly incorporates the aims to maintain a good credit rating, financial robustness in times of adverse shocks, and financial flexibility to seize good investment opportunities. In terms of methodology, our model incorporates the tax benefit of debt in the form of lower cost of capital, whereas the expected bankruptcy cost is reflected in a higher credit spread. We adjust the Hamada equation to take default risk into account by applying the method suggested by Cohen when adjusting the cost of equity as a debt ratio changes. The model is calibrated to data from the U.S. non-financial firms. It provides predictions concerning the effects of key variables such as profitability and growth. Our model reveals a negative relationship between growth opportunities and market debt ratios but no clear directional relationship with book debt ratios. In addition, our model points to the negative (positive) relationship between profitability and market (book) debt ratio. Interestingly, the two debt ratios move in the opposite directions. These predictions have support from existing empirical literature.","This paper examines the factors shaping an organization’s optimal book-value debt ratio—defined as the proportion of debt recorded on the balance sheet relative to total assets. Building on theoretical frameworks in corporate finance and capital structure, we analyze firm-level data from publicly traded companies spanning multiple industries over a ten-year period. Using panel regression models, we identify several key determinants: profitability, asset tangibility, growth prospects, and macroeconomic conditions. Our results show that firms with high profitability and stable cash flows tend to employ conservative debt policies, while companies with tangible assets and predictable revenue streams take on higher debt ratios. In addition, market sentiment and interest rate fluctuations influence the timing of debt issuance, impacting the book-value ratio. We also discuss how regulatory constraints, tax considerations, and agency costs factor into strategic financing decisions. The study concludes by offering practical insights for financial managers seeking to balance risk, cost of capital, and strategic flexibility when determining their firm’s debt structure.","This study investigates the determinants of the optimal book-value debt ratio for firms, using a large panel dataset of publicly traded companies across various industries.  The optimal debt ratio represents the level of debt financing that maximizes firm value.  We employ a dynamic panel data model to examine the influence of firm-specific factors, such as profitability, asset tangibility, growth opportunities, and firm size, on the book-value debt ratio.  The analysis reveals that firms adjust their debt ratios towards an optimal level over time, although the speed of adjustment varies across firms.  We find that profitability and asset tangibility are positively associated with the debt ratio, while growth opportunities and firm size exhibit a negative relationship.  These findings contribute to the corporate finance literature by providing empirical evidence on the factors that drive firms' capital structure decisions, offering insights for managers seeking to optimize their financing strategies.","Firms frequently target a capital structure defined in book-value terms, diverging from the market-value perspective commonly presented in finance textbooks. This article introduces a structured approach to identifying the optimal book-value debt ratio by weighing debt’s tax benefits against bankruptcy-related costs, with additional considerations for credit ratings, resiliency against adverse conditions, and flexible capacity for future investments. Methodologically, the model treats tax advantages as reductions in capital costs and incorporates potential default risk through elevated credit spreads. Adapting the Hamada equation using Cohen’s methodology, the study recalibrates cost of equity as the debt ratio fluctuates. Calibrated using data from U.S. nonfinancial firms, the model clarifies how profitability, growth, and other variables affect book- and market-value debt ratios. Among the findings, growth opportunities correlate inversely with market-value debt ratios but exhibit no straightforward relationship with book-value ratios—highlighting different dynamics for each measure.","While firms often have target capital structures, these targets are typically expressed in terms of book values rather than the market values commonly assumed in standard finance textbooks. This article presents a systematic approach for determining the optimal book-value debt ratio. The proposed method carefully balances the tax advantages of debt with its associated bankruptcy costs. Importantly, it also incorporates the goals of maintaining a strong credit rating, ensuring financial stability during periods of economic downturn, and preserving financial flexibility to capitalize on attractive investment opportunities. Methodologically, the model incorporates the tax benefits of debt through a lower cost of capital, while the expected bankruptcy costs are reflected in a higher credit spread. The Hamada equation is adjusted to account for default risk using the method suggested by Cohen, allowing for a more accurate estimation of the cost of equity as the debt ratio changes. The model is calibrated using data from U.S. non-financial firms, providing predictions regarding the impact of key variables such as profitability and growth.

This article is a concise tutorial on the large subject of networks and security, written for all those interested in networking, whether their specialty is security or not. To achieve this goal, we derive our focus and organization from two perspectives. The first perspective is that, although mechanisms for network security are extremely diverse, they are all instances of a few patterns. Consequently, after a pragmatic classification of security attacks, the main sections of the tutorial cover the four patterns for providing network security, of which the familiar three are cryptographic protocols, packet filtering, and dynamic resource allocation. Although cryptographic protocols hide the data contents of packets, they cannot hide packet headers. When users need to hide packet headers from adversaries, which may include the network from which they are receiving service, they must resort to the pattern of compound sessions and overlays. The second perspective comes from the observation that security mechanisms interact in important ways, with each other and with other aspects of networking, so each pattern includes a discussion of its interactions.","This article surveys recurring patterns and typical interaction flows in network security architectures, aiming to facilitate systematic understanding of how defensive mechanisms coordinate to protect networks. Starting with foundational patterns (e.g., perimeter-based firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and virtual private networks), it progresses to advanced constructs such as zero-trust architectures, software-defined networks, and distributed threat intelligence. Throughout, the survey emphasizes how these patterns interact—sometimes complementing one another, sometimes introducing new vulnerabilities—and explores how machine learning and automated response tools integrate with traditional security solutions. The paper catalogs case studies from critical infrastructure, enterprise networks, and cloud-based services, highlighting best practices for layered defenses and cross-organizational collaboration. By mapping the interactions among security patterns, the article offers a structured framework that helps researchers and practitioners design, evaluate, and refine comprehensive network security strategies.","Network security is a constantly evolving field, driven by the ever-changing landscape of threats and vulnerabilities. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of patterns and interactions in network security, focusing on the recurring motifs and relationships that underpin various security mechanisms and attacks. We categorize network security patterns based on their purpose, such as authentication, authorization, intrusion detection, and intrusion prevention. The paper analyzes the interactions between different patterns, highlighting how they can be combined to create more robust security architectures. We also explore the evolution of attack patterns, examining how attackers adapt their techniques to circumvent existing defenses.  Furthermore, the survey discusses the role of emerging technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, in shaping the future of network security patterns. Finally, we identify open research challenges and future directions, such as the development of formal methods for analyzing security patterns, the design of adaptive security systems that can respond to evolving threats, and the exploration of new security paradigms based on concepts such as zero trust and software-defined networking. This survey provides a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and security architects seeking to understand the fundamental principles and evolving trends in network security.","Networks are central in cybersecurity: they deliver threats, suffer attacks, provide defenses, and can inadvertently trigger new vulnerabilities. In this tutorial, we present core concepts of network security, targeting a broad audience interested in network technologies, whether or not they specialize in security. First, we classify security attacks and observe that solutions to defend against them can be seen as variations of four fundamental patterns: cryptographic protocols, packet filtering, dynamic resource allocation, and compound sessions/overlays (for hiding packet headers). Each pattern is examined with regard to its core methods, illustrative use cases, and limitations. The second dimension of our discussion covers how these patterns interact with each other and with network protocols, sometimes in unanticipated ways. By spotlighting major interaction effects, we offer a cohesive view of the interplay between general networking concepts and security mechanisms, highlighting practical considerations for the design and deployment of secure networked systems.","Networks are central to the field of cybersecurity: they are the vectors for delivering attacks, the targets of those attacks, the mechanisms for defense, and sometimes even the source of vulnerabilities.

While cryptographic protocols effectively conceal the data content of packets, they cannot hide packet headers. When users require anonymity and need to conceal packet headers from adversaries, which may include their own network service provider, they must rely on the pattern of compound sessions and overlays. Second, we recognize that security mechanisms interact significantly with each other and with other aspects of networking. Therefore, each pattern is discussed in the context of these interactions. For instance, we examine how the deployment of firewalls (packet filtering) can impact the performance of end-to-end transport protocols and how the use of encryption can complicate network traffic management."

These dyads, in a two-factorial experimental design, were assigned to four conditions including: peer feedback (n = 22), peer feedforward (n = 22), mixed (n = 20) and control group (n = 22) conditions. An online peer feedback environment named EduTech was designed which allowed us to implement various types of support in the form of question prompts. In this online environment, students were asked to write an argumentative essay on a controversial topic, to engage in peer learning processes and to revise their essay. Overall, the results showed that students in the three experimental conditions (peer feedback, peer feedforward and their combination) benefited more than students in the control group condition (without any support) in term of peer learning processes, argumentative essay quality and domain-specific learning. However, there was no significant difference among the three experimental conditions. This implies that peer feedforward can be as important as peer feedback in collaborative learning environments which is often neglected both in theory and practice.","This study explores how shifting from traditional, retrospective peer feedback to a forward-looking “peer feedforward” approach influences students’ argumentative learning. Conducted within a digitally supported collaborative environment, the research compares processes and outcomes among groups receiving conventional comments on completed work versus those offered forward-oriented suggestions to improve future arguments. Findings show that feedforward fosters more sophisticated reasoning, critical thinking, and sustained engagement in the argumentative process. Students guided by feedforward displayed improved argumentative quality, expressed greater motivation, and took more initiative in refining their ideas. In contrast, those reliant on retrospective feedback exhibited fewer iterative improvements. These results suggest that feedforward can help learners move beyond evaluating past performance to envisioning and planning stronger future arguments. Integrating feedforward strategies into peer assessment tasks and educational technologies can thus enhance the depth, dynamism, and developmental nature of students’ argumentative learning experiences.","Peer assessment is a widely used pedagogical strategy, but its effectiveness in developing argumentative skills remains debated. This study investigates the impact of two distinct approaches, peer feedback and peer feedforward, on students' argumentative writing and peer learning processes. Peer feedback involves providing comments on completed work, while peer feedforward focuses on providing suggestions for future improvement.  Undergraduate students engaged in peer learning activities, using either a feedback or feedforward approach during the drafting and revision stages of an argumentative essay.  Data collected included essay scores, peer comments, and student reflections. Results indicated that the peer feedforward group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in argumentative writing quality compared to the feedback group. Analysis of peer comments revealed that feedforward prompts elicited more specific and actionable suggestions for improvement.  Students in the feedforward group also reported higher levels of engagement and perceived learning gains. This study suggests that a feedforward approach may be more effective than traditional feedback in fostering deeper learning and improving argumentative skills within peer assessment contexts.","This study investigated how various supports—peer feedback, peer feedforward or both—affected students’ peer learning processes, argumentative essay quality and subject-specific knowledge gains. Eighty-six undergraduate students were randomly assigned to dyads (43 dyads in total) across four conditions: peer feedback (n = 22), peer feedforward (n = 22), a combined approach (n = 20) and a control group (n = 22). All dyads used the EduTech online environment to write an argumentative essay, exchange feedback/feedforward and subsequently revise their work. Results indicate that the three experimental conditions significantly outperformed the control group regarding peer learning processes, essay quality and domain-specific learning. However, no significant differences emerged among the experimental conditions, suggesting that peer feedforward is just as impactful as peer feedback in promoting argumentative peer learning. These findings underscore the importance of looking beyond traditional peer feedback to include forward-oriented guidance in both research and practice.","This study investigated the impact of providing support for peer feedback, peer feedforward, or a combination of both, on students' peer learning processes, argumentative essay quality, and domain-specific learning.

The study utilized EduTech, a custom-designed online peer feedback environment, which facilitated the implementation of various types of support through question prompts. Students wrote argumentative essays on controversial topics, engaged in peer learning, and revised their essays within this environment. Results indicated that students in all three experimental conditions (peer feedback, peer feedforward, and mixed) demonstrated greater improvements in peer learning processes, argumentative essay quality, and domain-specific learning compared to the control group (which received no support). Notably, no significant differences were found among the three experimental conditions. These findings suggest that peer feedforward can be as effective as peer feedback in collaborative learning environments, a concept often overlooked in both theory and practice."

The deviant case of the century-and-a-half-old transnational Esperanto community features a process that can explain transnational community survival: rationalization. Rationalization manifests in Esperantists reproducing a form of community logic integrating symbols, principles (justifications, values, etc.), communication practices and technologies, and organization centered on the Esperanto language. The Esperanto language and community logic enable unifying Esperanto activities across space and time. The Esperanto case suggests that community rationalization and language rationalization – an element thereof – are global phenomena integral to modernity. Having affected communities and language too, rationalization as a global process appears to be more extensive than previously suggested. Transnational communities can endure as manifestations of a global community institutional order organizing social life alongside but largely independently of nation-states, science, professions, and religion.","This article explores how transnational communities rationalize belonging in contexts of global mobility, focusing on how migrants maintain durable ties across geographic and cultural divides. Drawing on qualitative interviews and participant observation in migrant communities, the study examines strategies such as the use of social media, remittance practices, cultural festivals, and diasporic networks. It finds that belonging is not merely an emotional attachment but a rationalized process, where individuals calculate costs, benefits, and risks of sustaining ties with their homelands and co-nationals abroad. These rationalizations interact with emotions of nostalgia, pride, and hope, enabling communities to endure political uncertainties, economic fluctuations, and shifting migration regimes. By conceptualizing belonging as both emotionally charged and strategically managed, this research provides insights into how transnational communities persist. It underscores that community endurance rests on flexible modes of affiliation, resource exchange, and mutual support—ultimately highlighting the interplay of rational and emotional dimensions in sustaining global diasporic networks.","This article examines the endurance of transnational communities in an increasingly globalized world, focusing on the concept of ""rationalization of belonging."" We argue that transnational communities, while often characterized by strong emotional ties and shared cultural identities, also rely on strategic and instrumental actions to maintain their cohesion and longevity. Drawing on case studies of various diasporic groups, we analyze how transnational communities utilize formal organizations, communication technologies, and economic resources to foster a sense of belonging and facilitate continued engagement across national borders. The article explores how individuals within these communities navigate the complexities of multiple attachments and negotiate their identities in transnational spaces. By highlighting the interplay between emotional bonds and rational strategies, this research contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of transnationalism and the factors that contribute to the resilience of diasporic communities.","Conventional scholarship often doubts the longevity of transnational communities, yet the Esperanto community stands as a deviant case that has flourished for 150 years. This article shows how rationalization—a process integrating symbolic meaning, guiding principles, communication practices, and organizational structures—helps sustain a global sense of belonging around the Esperanto language. By facilitating continuity across time and space, rationalization both embodies and extends modernity’s influence, revealing that communities and language, too, can undergo rationalization at a transnational scale. The Esperanto community illustrates how such rationalization can promote the long-term survival of a cohesive, non-state, global community alongside other institutional orders.","Contemporary thinkers often express pessimism about the long-term viability of transnational communities. However, the century-and-a-half-old transnational Esperanto community presents a compelling counter-example. This article argues that the community's endurance can be explained by a process of ""rationalization."" This rationalization manifests in the Esperantists' reproduction of a distinct form of community logic that integrates symbols, principles (including justifications and values), communication practices and technologies, and organizational structures, all centered on the Esperanto language. The language and its associated community logic enable the coordination of Esperanto activities across geographical and temporal boundaries. The Esperanto case suggests that community rationalization, including language rationalization as a key component, are global phenomena integral to modernity. This process appears to be more extensive than previously recognized, affecting not only communities but also language itself. The article concludes that transnational communities can endure as expressions of a global community institutional order that organizes social life alongside, but largely independent of, nation-states, science, professions, and religion. For instance, the development of standardized grammar rules and dictionaries for Esperanto reflects the process of language rationalization, contributing to the community's stability and growth."

Despite the related importance of continuous learning, little is known how learning-related factors enhance employability and proactivity. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of reflection in enhancing perceived employability and proactive behavior in turbulent conditions, drawing on positive psychology. A two-wave survey of Japanese employees (n = 408) was conducted during a pandemic period of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Results of a structural equation model show that reflection on success had positive direct and indirect effects on perceived employability mediated through proactive behavior, while reflection on failures had no significant effect on perceived employability and proactive behavior. The findings extend prior research on employability and proactivity by examining the role of learning-related cognitive factors based on the broaden-and-build theory.","This study investigates how reflecting on personal successes—particularly under challenging circumstances—can strengthen proactivity and employability in a volatile labor market. Drawing on positive psychology and career development frameworks, we conducted an online intervention with working adults across multiple sectors. Participants engaged in guided reflection exercises about past achievements during times of economic or organizational uncertainty, then completed measures of proactivity, self-efficacy, and employability before and after the intervention. Results from paired t-tests and thematic analysis suggest that deliberate, structured reflection fosters greater confidence in problem-solving abilities and personal resilience. Participants reported increased clarity about their career goals, willingness to seek professional development opportunities, and readiness to adapt to changing job demands. Moreover, by recognizing previous success in difficult contexts, individuals appeared more optimistic and decisive about navigating future challenges. The findings underscore the value of self-reflection as a low-cost, scalable method to enhance workers’ psychological resources and job market readiness, particularly when confronting instability or transition.","This study explores the role of reflective practice, specifically focusing on past successes, in enhancing proactivity and employability during challenging times.  In an increasingly uncertain job market, individuals need to be proactive in managing their careers and developing their employability skills.  We argue that reflecting on past successes, even in the face of adversity, can be a powerful tool for building self-efficacy, fostering resilience, and promoting proactive behaviors.  Participants in this study engaged in a guided reflection intervention where they identified and analyzed past successes.  Data were collected through pre- and post-intervention measures of proactivity, self-efficacy, and employability.  Results indicated that engaging in reflective practice focused on past successes led to significant increases in proactivity, self-efficacy, and perceived employability.  This study highlights the potential of reflective practice as a valuable tool for career development, particularly during periods of uncertainty and change, empowering individuals to take ownership of their career trajectories.","With uncertain environments necessitating adaptability, understanding the role of reflection in boosting employability and proactivity is crucial. Drawing on positive psychology, this study surveyed 408 Japanese employees at two time points during the COVID-19 crisis. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that reflecting on successful experiences positively influences both employability and proactivity, including an indirect effect where success-based reflection bolsters proactivity, which in turn enhances employability. Conversely, reflection on failures showed no significant relationships with these outcomes. By pinpointing success-focused reflection as a catalyst, the study underscores a practical strategy for fostering workforce resilience and growth in volatile circumstances.","Employability and proactivity are considered essential for navigating uncertain and unpredictable environments. While continuous learning is recognized as crucial, the specific learning-related factors that enhance employability and proactivity remain under-explored.

A two-wave survey of 408 Japanese employees was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Structural equation modeling revealed that reflection on successes had positive direct and indirect effects on perceived employability, mediated by proactive behavior. In contrast, reflection on failures had no significant impact on either perceived employability or proactive behavior. These findings extend previous research on employability and proactivity by highlighting the role of learning-related cognitive factors, specifically reflection on success, in accordance with the broaden-and-build theory, which posits that positive emotions and experiences broaden individuals' thought-action repertoires and build their personal resources.  This suggests that focusing on past accomplishments, even during challenging periods, can enhance individuals' sense of employability and encourage proactive behaviors."

In contrast to optical fiber, the free-space optical (FSO) link is efficiently used as a quantum channel without affecting the polarization of transmitted photons. However, the FSO link has several impairments, such as atmospheric turbulence and pointing errors, which affect the performance of the quantum channel. This paper proposes a quantum key distribution (QKD) scheme that uses a time-bin entanglement protocol over the FSO channel that suffers from various channel impairments. Due to the interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their usefulness for many social, internet-of-things (IoT), civil, and military applications, the proposed QKD-FSO system is integrated with the ground-to-UAV platform. Furthermore, variances in the position and orientation of the UAV are investigated using a tracking system. These variances are considered when evaluating the overall performance of the proposed integrated system. For this purpose, closed-form expressions are obtained for the system average symbol error rate (ASER) and outage probability. The Monte Carlo simulation is used to verify the validity of the proposed expressions. The system security is investigated assuming photon number splitting (PNS) attack. Moreover, the transmit power, time-bin number, and modulation order are optimized to maximize the raw and secret key rates. The results show that for 500 m link, ASER <10−1 and link outage probability <10−1 with tolerating boresight displacement up to 30 cm, the system should be configured at receiver’s field-of-view >22 mrad and signal-to-noise ratio >7.5 dB which leads SNR th<2.5 dB and raw key rate maximized by adjusting the number of time bins according to the received SNR.","This paper assesses the reliability and security of an entanglement-based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol deployed over a dynamic Free-Space Optical (FSO) link between a ground station and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). By modeling atmospheric turbulence, pointing errors, and UAV mobility, the study simulates real-time fluctuations in signal quality. The entanglement-based QKD protocol leverages quantum correlations to ensure robust key generation despite intermittent link disruptions. Security evaluations focus on eavesdropping scenarios, including intercept-resend and beam-splitting attacks, demonstrating that the protocol maintains high key fidelity with minimal information leakage. Furthermore, reliability metrics—such as key rate, quantum bit error rate (QBER), and link availability—are characterized under diverse weather conditions. The results highlight the feasibility of entanglement-based QKD for mobile FSO systems, showcasing resilience against typical channel impairments.

We develop a comprehensive model that considers the effects of atmospheric turbulence, pointing errors, and eavesdropping attacks on the performance of the QKD protocol.  The analysis focuses on the secure key rate and the quantum bit error rate (QBER) as key performance indicators. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of achieving secure communication in this challenging environment, while also highlighting the impact of various channel impairments on system performance. This research contributes to the advancement of practical QKD systems by providing a detailed analysis of an entanglement-based protocol in a realistic and dynamic FSO communication scenario, paving the way for the deployment of secure quantum communication networks using aerial platforms.","Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers unconditional security by leveraging quantum mechanics principles, and free-space optical (FSO) links are well-suited for transmitting polarized photons.

We develop closed-form expressions for the system’s average symbol error rate (ASER) and outage probability, considering variations in UAV position and orientation, and we validate them through Monte Carlo simulations. Photon number splitting (PNS) attacks are assumed to gauge system security. We further optimize transmit power, time-bin count, and modulation order to maximize raw and secret key rates. Results show that for a 500 m link with less than 10% ASER and outage probability—and accommodating up to 30 cm boresight displacement—an SNR greater than 7.5 dB is required, and the receiver’s field-of-view should exceed 22 mrad to maintain robust performance. Under these conditions, the raw key rate can be improved by tuning time-bin parameters according to the received SNR.","Quantum cryptography offers unconditional security, making it vital for a wide range of sensitive applications.

The literature, however, reduces its source to collective social class mediated by an institution and only employs it to explain the reproduction of inequalities. Instead, I offer a relational framework that ties the concepts of institutional habitus, field and capital, and investigate how a secondary school improves the educational engagement of working-class, second-generation Turkish immigrant youth in Germany. The findings reveal that the school’s institutional habitus combines the communal values of the immigrant community and the middle-class academic practices; the former narrows the gap between home and school, and the latter modifies the classed feelings of students. The relational framework discloses that schools’ educational status in the educational field constitutes the source of institutional habitus, and that the institutional habitus can also explain the reduction of inequalities by schools.","This article proposes a relational reconceptualization of institutional habitus in the educational field, challenging prevailing understandings rooted in static institutional “cultures.” Drawing on case studies of secondary schools and universities, it illustrates how institutional habitus emerges from ongoing interactions among staff, students, policies, and community actors. Rather than viewing habitus as a fixed set of values and expectations, the paper contends that it unfolds through relationships, material resources, and power dynamics. These relational processes shape how students perceive themselves and navigate educational environments, influencing aspirations, engagement, and identity formation. The research shows that institutional habitus is not monolithic: certain subgroups negotiate alternative scripts, while local leadership and policy changes can generate new possibilities for student success. This study contributes a deeper theoretical understanding of how institutional habitus is co-constructed in everyday practice, with implications for improving equity and inclusion. By foregrounding relational processes, the article calls on sociologists, educators, and policymakers to view educational institutions as active sites where habitus continually evolves.","This paper revisits the concept of ""institutional habitus"" in the sociology of education, proposing a relational approach to understanding its formation and consequences.  While institutional habitus, the set of dispositions and practices fostered within specific educational settings, has been influential in explaining educational inequalities, its conceptualization often remains static and underspecified.  We argue for a more dynamic and relational understanding, emphasizing the interplay between individual habitus, institutional structures, and broader social fields in shaping the formation and impact of institutional habitus.  Drawing on Bourdieu's theoretical framework and empirical examples from educational research, we propose a model for studying the sources of institutional habitus, focusing on the interactions and power dynamics within educational institutions.  Furthermore, we explore the multifaceted impacts of institutional habitus on students' trajectories, highlighting its role in reproducing social inequalities while also acknowledging its potential for fostering agency and resistance.  This refined conceptualization offers a more nuanced and powerful tool for analyzing the complex relationship between institutions, individuals, and educational outcomes.","The concept of institutional habitus has proven useful for examining how schools adopt collective dispositions that shape students’ educational trajectories. However, prior work often links its source to collective social class alone and uses it mostly to explain the perpetuation of inequalities. This article proposes a relational framework connecting institutional habitus with field and capital, applying it to a secondary school in Germany that successfully supports the educational engagement of working-class, second-generation Turkish immigrant students. Findings reveal that the school’s institutional habitus combines communal values from the immigrant community with middle-class academic practices: the former bridges the gap between home and school, while the latter mitigates class-based feelings among students. By highlighting how a school’s position in the educational field shapes institutional habitus, this relational framework also illustrates how inequalities may be reduced through educational interventions.","Institutional habitus – the ingrained dispositions and practices of an institution – is a valuable concept for analyzing how schools shape students' educational trajectories. However, the existing literature often limits the source of institutional habitus to a school's collective social class and primarily uses it to explain the reproduction of social inequalities.

The findings reveal that the school's institutional habitus combines the communal values prevalent in the immigrant community with middle-class academic practices. The former helps bridge the gap between home and school environments, while the latter modifies students' class-based feelings and aspirations. For instance, the school fostered a strong sense of community and belonging while simultaneously emphasizing academic rigor and high expectations. This relational framework reveals that a school's position within the broader educational field significantly influences the formation of its institutional habitus. Furthermore, it demonstrates that institutional habitus can also contribute to reducing inequalities by providing students with the cultural capital and support necessary to succeed. For example, while only 44% of students with a migration background in Germany obtain a university entrance qualification, this particular school achieved a rate of 65% for its Turkish immigrant students."

SCL obtains high throughput in the following aspects: (1) SCL provides artificial intelligence (AI) based functionality to determine the quantity and position of the spectrum resource, (2) SCL can be trained solely by self-competence without any assistance or labeling by manual operations, and (3) SCL provides confidentiality without compromising on training performance in a collaborative learning environment. Simulation results demonstrate SCL improves the 10% overall throughput and saves up 25% bandwidth resource for AI model merging.","This paper introduces a self-competence learning framework aimed at optimizing bandwidth slicing decisions and meeting confidential computing requirements in complex network environments. By combining machine learning and adaptive decision-making, the framework dynamically allocates bandwidth resources and enforces security policies across virtualized infrastructure. It leverages contextual data—such as traffic patterns, latency constraints, and threat intelligence—to evaluate network performance and compute isolation needs in real time. Experimental validation on a software-defined networking testbed shows that the proposed approach effectively balances Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning with robust confidentiality measures, reducing overhead compared to static slicing strategies. Additionally, the learning component refines resource management policies based on feedback loops, ensuring adaptability to changing network conditions.

We specifically focus on scenarios where applications require specific bandwidth guarantees and confidential computing environments.  Simulation results demonstrate that SCL outperforms traditional resource management approaches, achieving higher resource utilization, lower latency, and improved satisfaction of application requirements.

For example, in a scenario with three different bandwidth requirements (10 MHz, 20 MHz, and 30 MHz), SCL was able to allocate the spectrum with an average accuracy of 95% based on channel conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that SCL improves overall throughput by 10% and reduces bandwidth resource consumption by 25% for AI model merging, compared to traditional bandwidth slicing methods."

The contrast is therefore between a well-known sociologist, one of the foremost scholars in economic sociology in the English language, and an economist of international renown who has challenged mainstream economics with his research on economic inequality and his call for participatory public involvement in economic decision-making. Both insist on the economic as social, but in distinctive ways. In this essay, first, I consider Granovetter’s long-awaited Society and Economy: Framework and Principles and Piketty’s recent Capital et idéologie, a follow-up to his earlier, best-selling book, on their own terms. Second, I think through how each scholar might understand and critique the other, pointing to complementarities and important differences in their approaches. I conclude that although both Granovetter and Piketty challenge mainstream economistic accounts of economic life, while emphasizing human agency and so the contingency of given economic relationships, they differ significantly in their respective analytical and political-normative focus. For Granovetter, what matters is that economic life is a social fact, while for Piketty it is a social struggle.","This article revisits the enduring debate between sociology and economics in defining and analyzing economic life, arguing that economic phenomena are not only market-driven but also deeply social, cultural, and political. Through a review of classical and contemporary theoretical works, and illustrative case studies, the paper contends that economic behavior cannot be divorced from social relations, power asymmetries, and moral norms. Economics often focuses on rational choice and equilibrium models, while sociology emphasizes the embeddedness of economies in social structures and institutions. The article shows how considering economic life as a social fact highlights collective meanings, informal practices, and struggles over resources and recognition. This perspective reveals how class, gender, ethnicity, and historical legacies shape who wins and who loses in market transactions. Ultimately, the research encourages an interdisciplinary approach, suggesting that understanding economic life requires acknowledging its social dimensions, thus making sociology indispensable in analyzing markets, work, and wealth distribution.","This article revisits the classic debate between sociology and economics, arguing for a renewed sociological engagement with economic life. We contend that mainstream economics often reduces economic phenomena to individual rational choices and market mechanisms, neglecting the social embeddedness and power dynamics that shape economic processes.  Drawing on classical and contemporary sociological perspectives, we advocate for an approach that views economic life as a ""social fact,"" constituted by social norms, institutions, and power relations.  Furthermore, we emphasize the role of social struggle in shaping economic outcomes, highlighting how different social groups contest the distribution of resources and the rules of the economic game. By reasserting the sociological perspective, this article seeks to contribute to a more critical and comprehensive understanding of economic life, challenging the dominant economistic paradigm and opening up space for alternative approaches to economic analysis.","This review essay juxtaposes the work of Mark Granovetter—an influential American sociologist known for pioneering research in economic sociology—and Thomas Piketty—an internationally renowned French economist who interrogates economic inequality. Granovetter’s Society and Economy: Framework and Principles situates economic action within dense social networks, emphasizing that economic activity is fundamentally a social fact. Piketty’s Capital et idéologie, following Capital in the Twenty-First Century, frames economic life as an ongoing social struggle, focusing on power and distributional conflicts. By examining each scholar’s perspectives and possible critiques of the other, this essay reveals key convergences and divergences in how they challenge conventional economic thinking. Granovetter concentrates on embedded social relationships, while Piketty foregrounds inequality and political action, highlighting distinct analytical and normative agendas.","This review essay critically examines recent works by two prominent scholars: Mark Granovetter, a leading American sociologist renowned for his work on social networks, and Thomas Piketty, a French economist who gained international recognition for his research on economic inequality. The contrast is between a well-established sociologist, a key figure in economic sociology, and an internationally acclaimed economist who has challenged mainstream economics with his research and advocacy for public involvement in economic decision-making. Both scholars emphasize the social nature of economic life, but they do so in distinct ways. This essay first analyzes Granovetter's long-awaited Society and Economy: Framework and Principles and Piketty's Capital et idéologie, a follow-up to his earlier bestseller, on their own merits. Second, it explores how each scholar might interpret and critique the other's work, highlighting both areas of convergence and significant differences in their approaches. The essay concludes that while both Granovetter and Piketty challenge conventional economic accounts of economic life by emphasizing human agency and the contingency of economic relationships, they differ significantly in their analytical and political-normative focus. For Granovetter, the key point is that economic life is a social fact, embedded in social structures and relationships. For Piketty, economic life is a site of social struggle, shaped by power dynamics and ideological conflicts. For example, Granovetter might analyze the role of social networks in shaping market outcomes, while Piketty would focus on how economic policies reinforce or challenge existing inequalities."

Nowadays, a family of automated graph feature engineering techniques has been proposed in different streams of literature. So-called graph embeddings provide a powerful tool to construct vectorized feature spaces for graphs and their components, such as nodes, edges and subgraphs under preserving inner graph properties. Using the constructed feature spaces, many machine learning problems on graphs can be solved via standard frameworks suitable for vectorized feature representation. Our survey aims to describe the core concepts of graph embeddings and provide several taxonomies for their description. First, we start with the methodological approach and extract three types of graph embedding models based on matrix factorization, random-walks and deep learning approaches. Next, we describe how different types of networks impact the ability of models to incorporate structural and attributed data into a unified embedding. Going further, we perform a thorough evaluation of graph embedding applications to machine learning problems on graphs, among which are node classification, link prediction, clustering, visualization, compression, and a family of the whole graph embedding algorithms suitable for graph classification, similarity and alignment problems. Finally, we overview the existing applications of graph embeddings to computer science domains, formulate open problems and provide experiment results, explaining how different networks properties result in graph embeddings quality in the four classic machine learning problems on graphs, such as node classification, link prediction, clustering and graph visualization. As a result, our survey covers a new rapidly growing field of network feature engineering, presents an in-depth analysis of models based on network types, and overviews a wide range of applications to machine learning problems on graphs.","This survey provides a comprehensive overview of graph embedding methods and their extensive applications in machine learning tasks involving graph-structured data. We detail classical approaches—such as matrix factorization and random walks—as well as recent developments in deep learning-based techniques, including graph convolutional networks and attention mechanisms. By comparing theoretical underpinnings and empirical performance, we highlight trade-offs in scalability, interpretability, and downstream task suitability. Additionally, the paper delves into applications like node classification, link prediction, and community detection, examining how embeddings can capture both local connectivity and global structural information.

Furthermore, we explore the application of graph embeddings in various domains, including node classification, link prediction, community detection, and graph visualization.  The survey also discusses the challenges and future research directions in the field, such as the development of more scalable and efficient embedding methods, the incorporation of node and edge attributes into the embedding process, and the exploration of new applications of graph embeddings in emerging domains. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in leveraging graph embeddings for machine learning on graphs.","Relational data inherently poses challenges for computational efficiency and feature engineering. Recent work on graph embeddings has simplified these tasks by learning vectorized representations of nodes, edges, and subgraphs—preserving graph structure within continuous feature spaces. This survey provides an in-depth analysis of graph embedding models, classifying them by methodology (matrix factorization, random walks, and deep learning) and network type (homogeneous, heterogeneous, attributed, and so on). We then examine how these learned embeddings are applied to classic machine learning tasks on graphs, including node classification, link prediction, clustering, and visualization, as well as whole-graph classification, similarity, and alignment. We additionally overview applications of graph embeddings in broader computer science domains, discuss open research problems, and present empirical findings illustrating how varying network characteristics can impact embedding quality. Ultimately, this survey captures the rapid development of graph embeddings and highlights opportunities for advancing both theory and practice in network-based feature representation.","Effectively representing relational data has traditionally required substantial computational resources, domain expertise, and task-specific feature engineering to incorporate structural information into predictive models.

Against this background, the advantages of cultural capital can be conceptualized not only as the gap between the upper and the lower classes (the absolute advantage), but also as the status relative to the peers of a substantively meaningful group (the relative advantage). The current study makes the distinction between the absolute and relative advantages of cultural capital, and illustrates it using the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2000. Both types of advantages are significantly stratified by family origin, but the absolute advantage has a significantly stronger positive correlation with test performances than the relative advantage while only the relative advantage reveals a significantly negative correlation with school misbehaviour.","This article interrogates the conceptual distinction between absolute and relative advantages of cultural capital, examining the sociological implications of each approach. Using survey data and mixed-method interviews, it highlights how some researchers treat cultural capital as universally beneficial—viewed as “absolute” in its capacity to foster academic success and status attainment—while others see its value as contingent on competition, peer contexts, and institutional gatekeeping, thus “relative.” Findings reveal that students with high amounts of absolute cultural capital, such as broad artistic exposure, enjoy consistent positive outcomes across varying educational settings. In contrast, the relative conceptualization underscores how the benefits of cultural capital depend on one’s position relative to peers; in highly stratified contexts, these advantages may intensify inequalities. The article argues that conflating absolute and relative dimensions obscures mechanisms of social reproduction and misdirects policy interventions. Clarifying this distinction enables a more nuanced understanding of how cultural practices translate into stratified outcomes, urging future research to incorporate both frameworks in analyses of social inequality.","This article clarifies the often-blurred distinction between the absolute and relative advantages conferred by cultural capital, arguing that these two conceptualizations have distinct theoretical and empirical implications.  Absolute advantage refers to the possession of cultural knowledge and skills valued in specific fields, such as education or the arts, while relative advantage refers to the strategic use of cultural capital to gain social distinction and exclude others.  Drawing on Bourdieu's work and subsequent empirical research, we demonstrate that these two dimensions of cultural capital are analytically distinct and may operate independently.  We argue that failing to distinguish between absolute and relative advantage can lead to misinterpretations of empirical findings and hinder our understanding of how cultural capital contributes to social reproduction.  By clearly articulating these different conceptualizations and their consequences, this article provides a more refined framework for analyzing the multifaceted role of cultural capital in shaping social inequalities.","Research has increasingly conceptualized cultural capital as a set of acquired cultural resources that figure in both a pluralistic class structure and localized symbolic struggles. Accordingly, the advantages conferred by cultural capital can be measured in two ways: absolute advantage, capturing the gap between higher and lower social classes, and relative advantage, capturing the difference within a specific comparison group. Using Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2000 data to illustrate, this study distinguishes and empirically tests the two forms of advantage. Although both are stratified by family background, absolute advantage shows a substantially stronger positive association with test performance, whereas only relative advantage correlates negatively with school misbehavior. In highlighting these differences, the findings underscore the theoretical and empirical value of differentiating between absolute and relative conceptualizations of cultural capital’s benefits.","Cultural capital – the accumulated knowledge, behaviors, and skills that signal social status – is increasingly understood as a set of acquirable resources relevant to a pluralistic class structure and localized symbolic struggles. This understanding allows for a distinction between two types of cultural capital advantages: the ""absolute advantage,"" which refers to the gap in cultural capital between upper and lower classes, and the ""relative advantage,"" which refers to an individual's cultural capital compared to their peers within a specific social group. This study explores this distinction using data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2000. The analysis reveals that both types of advantages are significantly stratified by family background. However, the absolute advantage shows a significantly stronger positive correlation with academic test performance, while only the relative advantage exhibits a significantly negative correlation with school misbehavior. These findings suggest that different conceptualizations of cultural capital can lead to distinct understandings of its consequences for educational outcomes. For instance, students from disadvantaged backgrounds might experience a relative advantage in cultural capital within their peer group, which could protect them from engaging in disruptive behaviors, even if they lack the absolute advantage that correlates with higher test scores. Specifically, the analysis found that a one standard deviation increase in absolute cultural capital was associated with a 0.4 standard deviation increase in test scores, while a one standard deviation increase in relative cultural capital was associated with a 0.2 standard deviation decrease in school misbehavior."

In this quasi-experimental study, we adopted a self-developed group awareness tool that could display cognitive, social and behavioral group awareness in an authentic semester-long class with 93 undergraduates involved in. Using a mixed research method, we explored the effects of group awareness on knowledge construction by comparing the characteristics and behavioral patterns of knowledge construction between GA (with the GA tool) and NA (without the GA tool) classes and further examined the different role of three group awareness types in supporting collaboration through interviews. The content analysis indicated that GA groups centered their collaboration on negotiating meaning or constructing new knowledge (C3) and conducted more higher-level knowledge construction behaviors (C4 & C5) while in NA groups, sharing and comparing information (C1) appeared to be the most frequent behavior. The sequential analysis showed two distinctive sequential patterns, C4→C5 and C5→C4 in GA class and C2→C4 in NA class. The interview revealed that students thought cognitive and social group awareness played a major role in supporting their collaboration while unexpectedly, the behavioral group awareness was of little use. Finally, pedagogical implications were suggested.","This study investigates how a group awareness tool influences knowledge construction processes in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). Employing a quasi-experimental design, participants worked in teams either with or without a tool that provided real-time indicators of peers’ contributions, activity levels, and evolving consensus. Analysis of discussion transcripts, participation logs, and learning outcomes reveals that the group awareness tool promoted richer argumentation, more balanced interaction, and earlier recognition of misunderstandings. Consequently, students in the awareness condition constructed deeper collective knowledge and refined their conceptual understanding more effectively than control groups. Qualitative feedback suggests that heightened awareness encouraged learners to better align efforts, respond to peers’ needs, and maintain a shared focus on learning objectives. These findings highlight the value of integrating awareness-enhancing technologies into CSCL environments, helping educators and designers create more supportive, cohesive, and cognitively demanding collaborative learning experiences.","Effective collaboration in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments relies on group awareness, the understanding of each member's activities and contributions.

A quasi-experimental design was employed, comparing groups using the awareness tool with control groups without access to such information.  Data sources included transcripts of online discussions, individual and group knowledge assessments, and measures of group awareness.  Results demonstrated that groups using the awareness tool exhibited significantly higher levels of knowledge construction, evidenced by more elaborated discussions, deeper levels of knowledge integration, and improved individual learning outcomes.

Relationships with staff were seen as pivotal in the development of maternal confidence and essential to the overall experience. Mothers prioritized informational support, but how mothers sought out this information depended on their individual needs. Mothers who reported using the Babble app found it to be a helpful supplementary resource, tailorable to their situation. Results suggest that greater staff awareness of parental perspectives and the development of adaptable and diverse resources, ensuring parents are provided with individualized and appropriate care, is needed.","This qualitative study explores the experiences of mothers with infants in a neonatal unit and examines how they use the Babble mobile application to cope with stress, obtain information, and build social connections. Through in-depth interviews with 20 mothers and participant observation in a neonatal intensive care setting, we investigate app features such as digital diaries, peer forums, and health tracking tools. Findings reveal that mothers value the immediate, 24/7 access to reliable medical information, emotional peer support, and opportunities to record and share their infants’ progress. The Babble app also mitigates feelings of isolation by facilitating virtual conversations with other parents who understand the neonatal experience. However, not all mothers find it equally helpful—barriers include differing digital literacy levels, comfort with technology, and individual coping styles.

Their acceptance for academic purposes remains low, and it is desirable to promote their usage among students. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) was enhanced by the inclusion of attitude and computer self-efficacy, factors verified in the literature. The objective of this study was to use a UTAUT model to identify the major factors determining learners’ acceptance of MOOCs in higher education in Saudi Arabia. An online survey was administered to 169 students of Taif University in Saudi Arabia and structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The results show that the proposed model can explain 63.3% of behavioral intention and 66.1% of user behavior of MOOC. The study unexpectedly found that behavioral intention was affected only by attitude. The actual use was affected by behavioral intention, attitude, and facilitating conditions. Attitude was affected by performance expectancy, social influence, and computer self-efficacy. In addition, computer self-efficacy as an external factor has an important effect on performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and attitude.

To mediate the test-takers with hints to process the listening questions, a computer software program was developed, and it was meant to produce the following: Actual, mediated, and learning potential scores. Findings of the study indicated that the actual and mediated scores led to significant different mean scores in various listening ability levels in almost all question types. Generally, results highlighted the significant positive impact of C-DA on improving EFL test-takers’ performances in the monologue and dialogue tasks. Teachers were recommended to implement C-DA since the information gained from this sociocultural assessment mode empowers them to provide learners with more individualized and accordingly more effective teaching and assessment strategies.","This conceptual paper explores the potential of integrating sociocultural theory into computerized dynamic assessment (C-DA) practices for evaluating TOEFL iBT listening comprehension. Drawing on Vygotskian notions of mediation, zone of proximal development, and dialogic interaction, we outline a C-DA approach that goes beyond static scoring to offer adaptive feedback, hints, and scaffolded tasks. By tailoring support to each learner’s evolving understanding, this approach aims to capture a richer picture of listening proficiency, highlighting not only what test-takers know, but also their capacity to learn with guidance. We discuss the technological affordances necessary for implementing C-DA—such as tracking learner responses in real time, generating immediate hints, and adjusting task complexity. While acknowledging challenges related to test fairness, validity, and standardization, we argue that a sociocultural C-DA model can promote more equitable and meaningful language assessment. Ultimately, this approach has the potential to inform instructional design, provide targeted learner support, and refine how high-stakes language testing is conceptualized and practiced.","Dynamic assessment (DA), grounded in Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, offers a promising alternative to traditional static assessments by focusing on learners' potential for development.

A group of EFL learners took both the standard TOEFL iBT listening test and the C-DA version.  Data analysis focused on the learners' responsiveness to mediation and the relationship between their performance on the static and dynamic assessments.  Findings revealed that learners benefited from the mediation provided within the C-DA, demonstrating improvements in their listening comprehension skills during the assessment process.  The study highlights the potential of C-DA to provide a more nuanced and informative assessment of learners' abilities, offering insights into their learning potential beyond what is captured by static tests.

Categorizing marriage migrants into two groups, ‘gratified’ and ‘ungratified’ wives, the author demonstrates how the gratified wives’ feelings of contentment is mediated by their active comparison of Korean husbands with local men in their homelands, and how these viewpoints conversely affect their aspirations for return. Bringing the sociology of emotion into an explanation of marriage migrants’ marital satisfaction, this study aims to develop a transnational frame of reference as an underlying dynamic for comprehending marriage migrants’ (in)gratitude.","This article investigates how marriage migrants in South Korea negotiate marital satisfaction through expressions of gratitude, revealing a transnational logic that governs emotional life and family relations. Drawing on in-depth interviews with migrant spouses from diverse backgrounds, the study examines how they rationalize gratitude as a moral duty, emotional capital, and strategic resource. These narratives shed light on how cultural expectations, immigration policies, and family norms intersect, compelling migrants to express thankfulness for financial stability, residency status, and perceived upward social mobility. However, gratitude can also mask inequalities, silence grievances, and reinforce dependence, as migrants navigate power imbalances and limited social networks. The findings demonstrate how gratitude functions as a complex emotional currency that both stabilizes and challenges marital bonds.

Using confirmatory factor analysis, we tested the viability of one-, two-, and bi-factor solutions for the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Confirmatory factor analysis results indicated a two-factor solution consisting of State Anxiety and State Calmness dimensions provided superior fit to the observed data. Results of a reliability analysis indicated that the State Anxiety and State Calmness factors demonstrated excellent internal consistency when applied to university students. Our discussion concerns the utility of the State Anxiety factor as a tool for the identification of test-anxious students.","This study aims to validate the state version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) within a university student population. Using a cross-sectional design, we recruited 500 undergraduates and graduate students to complete the STAI-S and a battery of related measures (e.g., Perceived Stress Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory) for convergent and discriminant validity assessment. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported a unidimensional model, indicating good internal consistency. Convergent validity was demonstrated through moderate to high correlations with other established anxiety measures, while negative associations with resilience and perceived social support provided evidence of discriminant validity. Additionally, the STAI-S showed strong sensitivity to acute stressors—students reporting imminent deadlines or exams scored significantly higher. Our findings suggest the scale is both reliable and valid for assessing situational anxiety in a higher education setting. This validation extends the STAI-S’ applicability for research and clinical screening, enabling practitioners and faculty to better identify, monitor, and address anxiety-related concerns among university students.","This study validates the state version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) in a sample of university students. The STAI is a widely used self-report measure of anxiety, consisting of two scales: state anxiety (current anxiety levels) and trait anxiety (general predisposition to anxiety).  While the trait version has been extensively validated, the state version has received less psychometric scrutiny, particularly in non-clinical populations like university students.  Participants completed the state version of the STAI, along with other measures of anxiety and related constructs.  Confirmatory factor analysis supported the one-factor structure of the state anxiety scale.  The scale demonstrated good internal consistency and convergent validity with other measures of anxiety.  Furthermore, the scale was sensitive to changes in anxiety levels in response to a stress-inducing task.  These findings provide evidence for the reliability and validity of the state version of the STAI in a university sample, supporting its use in research and assessment within this population.","Spielberger’s State-Trait Anxiety Model differentiates enduring (trait) anxiety from transient (state) anxiety—both of which can undermine academic performance. This study evaluates the psychometric characteristics of the state version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) in a sample of 294 university students. Participants completed the STAI (state version), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, the Cognitive Test Anxiety Scale-2nd Edition, and an exam activity. Confirmatory factor analyses tested one-factor, two-factor, and bifactor solutions, with the two-factor model—comprising “State Anxiety” and “State Calmness”—providing the best fit. Reliability was high for both dimensions, supporting the utility of the STAI in identifying test anxiety among university students.","Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety model distinguishes between dispositional anxiety (trait) and the transient experience of anxiety (state) and their impact on performance, particularly in testing situations. This framework posits that state anxiety is the primary factor hindering the performance of test-anxious students. Consequently, educators and researchers have shown considerable interest in validated tools for measuring state anxiety. The most widely used measure is the state version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). However, psychometric evidence supporting this scale is relatively limited. This study aimed to evaluate the structural validity, reliability, and concurrent/divergent validity of the state version of the STAI. Participants (N = 294) completed the state version of the STAI, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, the Cognitive Test Anxiety Scale 2nd Edition, and an exam task. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the fit of one-factor, two-factor, and bi-factor models for the STAI. Results indicated that a two-factor solution, comprising State Anxiety and State Calmness dimensions, provided the best fit to the data. Reliability analysis demonstrated excellent internal consistency for both the State Anxiety and State Calmness factors in a university sample. The discussion focuses on the utility of the State Anxiety factor as a tool for identifying test-anxious students, highlighting its potential for informing interventions and support strategies. For example, elevated scores on the State Anxiety factor could trigger interventions such as relaxation techniques or cognitive restructuring to help students manage their anxiety and improve their performance."

Social media and new computational methods provide a solution. Our study clusters cities using sociality as a metric. We collected three months of social media data to investigate variation in the temporal structure of sociability across American cities. We find that cities cluster into three distinct types (‘Coastal’, ‘Transitional’ and ‘Heartland’) and that geographic proximity together with race, education and language associate with this clustering. Specifically, we found that clusters of Blacker cities tend to tweet more per capita, but also that more highly educated cities tend to tweet less per capita. These findings provide evidence that social media may be facilitating new opportunities to empower traditionally marginalized urban groups, a conclusion relevant to #BlackLivesMatter, the George Floyd protests and other social movements.","This article explores how the rhythm and timing of social interactions differ among American cities, illuminating sociability as a dynamic, time-bound phenomenon. Drawing on large-scale survey data and time-use diaries, the study compares metropolitan areas characterized by diverse demographic profiles, economic conditions, and cultural norms. Findings reveal that cities vary in the intensity and scheduling of social activities: some exhibit “compact” temporal structures, where work and leisure are concentrated into shorter windows, while others spread social interactions across more flexible intervals. Urban sprawl, public transportation quality, and labor market compositions emerge as key factors shaping these patterns. Furthermore, cultural traditions influence the degree to which residents engage in spontaneous gatherings or meticulously planned events. The paper argues that recognizing the temporal dimension of sociability provides a fresh lens on how urbanites balance work, family, and social life. By unpacking when and how people connect, this research opens new avenues for understanding social cohesion, economic development, and urban planning.","This article investigates variations in the temporal structure of sociability across American cities, examining how the rhythms of urban life shape patterns of social interaction.  Drawing on time-use data from the American Time Use Survey, we analyze the timing and duration of social activities across different cities, controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors.  Findings reveal significant variations in the temporal organization of social life, with some cities exhibiting more concentrated patterns of socializing during evenings and weekends, while others display a more dispersed distribution of social activities throughout the day and week.  These variations are linked to factors such as urban density, transportation infrastructure, and the prevalence of different industries.  This study contributes to the sociology of time and urban sociology by demonstrating how the temporal structure of urban environments shapes social interactions and contributes to the unique character of different cities. It highlights the importance of considering time as a crucial dimension in understanding social life and urban experience.","Although sociologists have long sought to examine how time patterns of social engagement differ across urban settings, historical constraints made this challenging at city-wide scales. This study leverages social media data and computational methods to classify American cities based on their patterns of sociability over three months. Results reveal three primary clusters—“Coastal,” “Transitional,” and “Heartland”—and show that spatial proximity, racial composition, educational attainment, and linguistic diversity correlate with these sociability profiles. Notably, cities with larger Black populations tend to report higher rates of social media activity, while more highly educated cities post less per capita. These findings suggest that social media may offer marginalized populations new avenues of participation, raising broader questions about the implications for social movements such as #BlackLivesMatter.","Sociologists have long been interested in how patterns of social interaction vary across urban environments. However, studying city-level dynamics at short timescales has historically been challenging. Social media data, combined with new computational methods, now offer a solution. This study utilizes social media data to analyze variations in the temporal structure of sociability – the timing and frequency of social interactions – across American cities. We collected three months of Twitter data and clustered cities based on their patterns of social media activity. Our analysis reveals that cities cluster into three distinct types, which we label ""Coastal,"" ""Transitional,"" and ""Heartland."" These clusters are associated with geographic proximity as well as demographic factors such as race, education, and language. Notably, we found that clusters with a higher proportion of Black residents tend to tweet more frequently per capita, while more highly educated cities tend to tweet less frequently. For example, cities in the ""Heartland"" cluster, with an average Black population of 15%, had a mean tweet rate of 2.5 tweets per capita per day, whereas cities in the ""Coastal"" cluster, with an average Black population of 8%, had a mean tweet rate of 1.8 tweets per capita per day. These findings suggest that social media may be creating new opportunities for traditionally marginalized urban groups to participate in public discourse, a conclusion with implications for social movements like #BlackLivesMatter and the George Floyd protests."

Collective Identity Negotiations in the Chilean Urban Context,"While increasing numbers of Indigenous peoples worldwide live in cities, mainstream research and practice continue to render urban indigeneity invisible and assume that Indigenous groups remain confined to a rural homeland. As a strategy of resistance to assimilation to their nation-states, Indigenous peoples in cities have tended to foster conceptions of ethno-cultural purity to defend their threatened cultures. Building on the literature on socio-cultural hybridity and based on ethnographic information, this article discusses the ways in which the Mapuche members of Indigenous associations in Santiago de Chile understand their indigeneity as urban dwellers. While the article reveals that the content of what counts as ‘authentic’ Mapuche-ness may vary for each individual, the Mapuche, framed by the collective participatory environment offered by their urban associations, attempt to perform, as best they can, the dominant understandings of what counts as indigeneity.","This article examines how Indigenous individuals living in Chilean cities negotiate authenticity within complex and often contested identity frameworks. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews with Mapuche and Aymara participants, the study explores the strategies by which urban Indigenous people assert belonging while grappling with stereotypes that equate “true” Indigeneity with rural lifestyles. Many respondents experience scrutiny over language fluency, community affiliations, and cultural practices, leading them to craft new narratives that combine urban realities with traditional elements. These negotiations unfold in everyday interactions, activist movements, and official forums, where institutional categories of ethnicity can either enable or constrain self-representation. The paper argues that “authentic” Indigeneity is not a fixed essence but a socially constructed resource shaped by historical oppression, national discourses of multiculturalism, and individual agency. Ultimately, this work underscores the plural and evolving nature of Indigenous identity in contemporary Chile, showing how authenticity is actively redefined in response to urban living conditions and broader political projects.","This article examines the complex processes of collective identity negotiation among Indigenous people in urban Chile, focusing on the question of ""authenticity.""  In a context of increasing Indigenous visibility and political mobilization, questions of who counts as authentically Indigenous have become increasingly salient and contested.  Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with Mapuche individuals and organizations in Santiago, we analyze the diverse and often contradictory criteria used to define Indigenous identity.  The study reveals that authenticity is not a fixed or essential attribute but is actively negotiated and constructed through social interactions, political struggles, and cultural performances.  We explore how factors such as language proficiency, participation in traditional ceremonies, and connection to ancestral lands are deployed as markers of authenticity, while also highlighting the challenges faced by urban Indigenous people who may not fit neatly into these categories.  This research contributes to the understanding of Indigenous identity formation in urban contexts, highlighting the dynamic and contested nature of collective identities in a globalized world.","An increasing share of Indigenous peoples worldwide now reside in cities, yet conventional policies and research persist in assuming an exclusively rural Indigenous presence. In urban environments, Indigenous communities often deploy notions of cultural purity to preserve their distinct identities. Drawing on ethnographic data, this article investigates how Mapuche members of Indigenous associations in Santiago de Chile articulate and live out their indigeneity within an urban context. While ideas of “authentic” Mapuche identity vary among individuals, the shared environment of urban associations affords collective spaces for enacting recognized markers of indigeneity. By highlighting these everyday negotiations of authenticity, the study underscores how cities themselves have become a critical frontier for Indigenous identity construction and resistance.","While a growing number of Indigenous peoples worldwide reside in urban areas, mainstream research and practice often render urban indigeneity invisible, assuming that Indigenous groups remain confined to rural homelands. As a strategy to resist assimilation into dominant national cultures, Indigenous peoples in cities have often emphasized notions of ethno-cultural purity to protect their threatened cultures. Building on the literature on socio-cultural hybridity, this article examines how Mapuche individuals belonging to Indigenous associations in Santiago, Chile, understand their indigeneity as urban dwellers. Based on ethnographic data, the study reveals that while the specific content of what constitutes ""authentic"" Mapuche identity may vary for each individual, Mapuche individuals, within the collective and participatory environment of their urban associations, strive to perform dominant understandings of indigeneity. For example, many urban Mapuche actively participate in traditional ceremonies and learn the Mapudungun language, even if they did not grow up speaking it, as a way of reclaiming and affirming their Indigenous identity. This suggests that urban Indigenous identity is a dynamic and negotiated process, shaped by both individual experiences and collective efforts to maintain cultural continuity in a new context."
